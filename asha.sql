The region in which these pre-primary centers are located has a high incidence of first generation learners. In most families, both parents are not educated. Given this, the parents are not inclined to send their children to school and education is not considered important. Daily wage labour is the sole means of earning an income. Parents prefer their elder children to go to work. There is also a high rate of migration of the male members of the families from this region towards the city. This has resulted in a number of families with single mothers supporting thier children. \r\n\r\nIn order to solve this problem, Aralu, the local grassroots partner came up with the idea of opening pre-primary or day-care centers. The day care centers were created for the children, aged 6 and under. \r\n\r\nWhen the project began, Asha Chicago started with supporting two pre-primary centers; one in the village of Kamthana and another in Yedlapur. \r\n\r\nThe three year plan at the time of inceptiuon was continuing the centers and creating a continued aptitude for schooling. A five year plan includes enrolling the children into mainstream education. \r\n\r\nWith this in mind, over the last few years, Aralu has been working with the local authorities to improve the scenario in the government run Anganwadis or day care centers.

Asha Chicago continues to fund the other pre-primary center in Yedlapur as conditions are not conducive for a similar transition as yet. \r\n\r\nAralu believes that this model of theirs is proving extremely beneficial in the region and therefore requested opening more pre-primary centers in other villages where the need was felt.

As is well known, poor families in India deem children as source of income. The tendency is to withdraw children from school and place them in menial chores. Also, children receive no encouragement to study or help in completing homework. \r\n\r\nChetanaa was started to provide a learning environment for such students. The children attend the government school in the area. The facility at Chetanaa provides them additional help so that the children feel motivated to learn and stay in school. They are provided extra coaching and help in homework. They are taught manners, moral values, and cleanliness concepts. To facilitate this, Chetanaa currently has three teachers, who teach students (in shifts) in the four classrooms.\r\n\r\nProfessor Sharda admits that one of the difficult problems is to keep students in school especially after middle school. She has to visit homes sometimes to convince the parents and children. In general, the project has been successful since many students have achieved top ranks in their class. \r\n\r\nThe main objectives of Chetanaa is to ensure that students complete elementary, middle, and high school with reasonable grades, and to keep the drop-out rate to a minimum. In addition, students are trained in moral and cleanliness concepts.\r\n\r\n\r\nLong Term Goal:\r\n\r\nCHETANAA wants that each child of CHETANAA receives the education atleast up to 10+2 level. CHETANAA also wishes to help them in getting some vocational training like computer education or other technical trainings at the proper institutes, so that these children can settle in life and earn their livelihood respectfully.

Several fictitious attributes are made to explain why the food is spoilt. Children are constantly exposed to this kind of unscientific messages in the home environment. Therefore it is necessary to develop a conviction in them about the role of Bacteria, Fungi and insects in food getting spoilt. Children need to know that toxins are produced in the stale food which can be dangerous or fatal.\r\n\r\nDairy and Sericulture are a subsidiary source of income for the people of Chamarajanagara. Therefore it is necessary for children to know some scientific details of managing the Dairy for Milk production and Sericulture for production of silk cocoons. \r\nIn dairy children will be trained about the relation ship between Milk yield and food fodder fed to the cow. The importance of Minerals in production of milk and health of the cow are also taught. Routine vaccinations and other health care are discussed.\r\nSimilarly in Sericulture the diseases of silk worms, its cause and remedy are discussed. This is more important because the blind beliefs in strong vogue are detrimental to the production and yield of dairy and sericulture. \r\n', 'Deena Badhu Trust', 'Deenabandhu is basically a home for children with a vision of developing orphan, destitute and estranged children towards achievement of their best potential by providing them a loving home and good education.

Almost all children come either from minority (about 70% Muslim Children) or from schedule cast social background. Education in Digantar schools is completely free for children. No fee is charged and all needed teaching-learning material, books and the school provides stationary. \r\n\r\nThe schools have been very successful academically and are liked a lot by the community. The curriculum, pedagogy and school organisation followed in these schools is based on the principles of learning with understanding, learning to learn and freedom of pace of learning. Consequently, the learning groups consist of children at different levels of learning rather than as homogeneous classes. \r\n\r\nTeacher child relationship is democratic and of mutual caring. Teachers have a very good rapport with the community and community has accepted as well as become quite fond of the new pedagogy used in these schools. \r\n\r\nThe schools provide education up to primary level (5 years of schooling) but from this academic session (1998-99); one group of 20 children is at the upper primary level as well. This has been started to extend to upper primary level the pedagogy and general approach to education being used at the primary level. \r\n\r\nThis programme can be called the fountainhead of all ideas and understanding, which Digantar uses in providing resource support to other organisations. Almost all ideas which we use in our approach to teaching-learning methodology, curriculum and material development and teacher education programmes have evolved and being evolved through teaching children in these schools.

In recent times, the treatment of Dalits has improved, but they still have limited opportunities and poor access to education.  Dalit children in this district are generally first-generation learners, often have to walk many miles to attend government schools, and cannot afford the private tutoring classes that most other students attend.\r\n\r\nThe Asha Junior Centers, consisting of a small building with a teacher, books, toys, and other resources, are essentially supplementary education and enrichment centers that the children attend before and/or after school.

The Asha Junior Center buildings themselves are constructed based on an innovative design by Lawrie Baker, which maximizes eco-friendliness while minimizing construction costs.

The women’s group, and the inter-village federation of women’s groups, provides women in the region with a platform to air their thoughts and concerns.  To provide additional empowerment, Asha provides initial capital for a microcredit program which is run by the women’s group and allows the village women to take low-interest loans to fund their own enterprises.  Income-generating activities that women in this area undertake include making and selling palm-leaf mats and coconut thatch, the retailing of soap and other consumer goods, opening small retail shops, selling snacks and other food items, etc.  As the women pay interest on their loans and as new loans are made, the capital in the microcredit fund grows.  It is expected that in about 3 years after the initiation of such a fund, the funds generated by this capital will be sufficient to fund the ongoing costs of the Asha Junior Center, allowing the center, in conjunction with the women’s group, to attain economic autonomy.

Emphasis is placed on three main areas: 1. Education through Basic Literacy Programs for children and adults, 2. Learn and earn vocational training and microcredit programs leading to economic independence and empowerment  of women and 3. Health and hygiene promotion  implemented by volunteers in the healthcare field.\r\nMatrichaya was created by Mrs Chanchala Mishra, whose association with the tribal community  extends over two decades. Following her husband?s untimely demise in 1984 she dedicated her life to the upliftment  of the community. She lived in their midst and was there when the villagers needed her help or advice.  The confidence of the tribals in her grew over the years.  She used her people skills to motivate like-minded volunteers to help her in her mission. She started a beauty training and fashion designing center where she reserved seats for tribal girls. She also started a line of herbal beauty therapy products and the proceeds were used to start activities in the village. She has acted as the voice of tribals against the  forces that try to take undue advantage of them.  One of the main reasons why people tried to take advantage of the tribals was their illiteracy. \r\nThe most effective way to bring about socioeconomic change was to educate children and women in the community. Despite government schools in the vicinity children continued to be illiterate. Children, especially females, were engaged in taking care of younger siblings or working as domestic help. She started a basic literacy center in Tikli Tola. Two teachers were employed from within the community. They taught part-time and were encouraged to attend college. The classes were conducted in rooms donated by the villagers. She used her own resources and contribution from family and friends to get the basic school supplies and snacks  which helped to motivate the children into coming to school initialy. She also started vocational training programs. She used her contacts to encourage physicians to volunteer their time and provide samples of medications in the fortnightly health camps organized by Matrichaya.  \r\n\r\n2004-2005 UPDATE\r\n*****************\r\nMatrichaya was established in 1994 by Chanchala Mishra, a  \r\nphilanthropist who strongly believes that education is the primary agent for socio-economic change. \r\n \r\nBased in the state of Jharkhand, the NGO''s primary goal is the upliftment of tribals in the area through 3 key initiatives: Basic education, learn-and-earn vocational training and through health and hygiene promotion. \r\n     \r\nTowards this effort, Matrichaya has adopted 7 villages in and around the state capital, Ranchi. \r\n \r\nWith the help of the local Rotary chapter, Matrichaya was able to fund a basic literacy program in two schools. Besides this, the Ranchi Corporation has supported the vocational training program for 30 women, while the State Bank Mahila Samiti has helped organize programs, supplied sewing machine, carpets, slates etc. \r\n\r\nMatrichaya has earmarked five other schools which require funding. These schools will also provide services such as regular meals, and uniforms for its students. \r\n\r\nThe volunteers at Asha Arizona strongly felt that its goal of providing basic education matches that of Matrichaya and the two can work together to make a difference. Asha has therefore approved funding of $9,939 over a period of 3 years towards expenses of the schools run by Matrichaya.\r\n\r\n', 'Matrichaya', 'Matrichaya''s Mission .............  \r\nTo bring about socio-economic changes in India through education of underprivileged  children and women. \r\n \r\nTo build a global network of smart committed philanthropists to achieve above goal. \r\n \r\n', 'The main objective of this project is to catalyze socioeconomic changes in Jharkhand, especially in the tribal villages of Kanke Block, Ranchi.

The children would develop traits and attributes that are necessary in succeeding and advancing into the mainstream education system. The schools that are currently operating are limited by the lack of funds.

They were involved with a court case to stop limestone mining in the Musoorie- Dehradun area. They were also involved with regreening the areas that were adversely affected by mining. Since then FOD has been involved with a wide variety of local environmental issues.  Since FOD is a Society (and not a trust), it has a governing body that is elected every year. All the current members of the governing body are persons who are retired and have settled in Dehradun. Though there is a formal governing body, there is effectively no hierarchy in the administration of the organization. Members of FOD pick their individual areas of interest and work in those areas.

The department therefore requested FOD to fill this gap by running a school here. \r\nFOD is keen to work with the Gujjars as this, according to them, is the only way to safeguard Rajaji National Park. FOD does plan to with draw form the Pathri project at some stage. Gradually, they would like local community institutions to take over the management of the school and other such initiatives that FOD has undertaken.

The team of project Asmaan works with a community living on the streets of Morland Road, near Kamathipura, the oldest red light area in Mumbai. All families are from Bihar, where they own small pieces of land. However, farming does not provide them enough to sustain and hence they have migrated to Mumbai. Most of the men are partially unemployed and the women are employed as domestic help in the nearby households for extremely low remunerations.\r\n\r\nThe groups who are affected the most are women and children.\r\n\r\nProblems of children\r\n·	Children are unable to go to school, as they either have to care for younger siblings or earn a living.\r\n·	Children have neither space nor time for recreation.\r\n·	Children, especially girls often get involved in the flesh trade due to proximity to the red light area.\r\n·	Children often face sexual abuse since they are left unprotected for a large part of the day.\r\n·	Girls are often married by the time they are 14 yrs.\r\n\r\nProblems of women\r\n·	Women have to take on dual responsibilities\r\n·	They have to go through repeated pregnancies with very little time for recuperation between two pregnancies. They are anemic and under nourished, thus endangering themselves with each pregnancy.\r\n·	Women are mostly illiterate. They find it difficult to find employment in any sector other than domestic work.\r\n·	They are paid poorly and treated badly by their employers.\r\n·	Very often they are divorced for no apparent reason.\r\n·	They also have to deal with the unfaithfulness of their husbands.\r\n\r\n \r\nAs  Project Asmaan enters in its third year, the team evaluated work of the last two  years & how one should move from here. The last year has seen many achievements some are as follows:\r\n		\r\n·	Awareness of medical services available to women in the target community\r\n·	Mobilization of government agencies to improve the community (Sanitation, Garbage etc).						\r\n·	10 cases of family planning.\r\n·	Active Participation in Meetings.\r\n·	Building of Trust of Women towards Municipal hospitals and resources.\r\n·	Ongoing informative sessions regarding tuberculosis, malaria, reproductive health, nutrition and other topics of concern.\r\n·	Monthly health checkups for children of Balwadi and Support Classes.\r\n·	Recreational Activities were held for the children (picnic, mela. Educational museum trip).\r\n·	1 community woman acting as attendant/ facilitator.\r\n·	Relationships of confidence built between staff and community women allowing for sharing of women’s personal problems.\r\n\r\nThese achievements were reached, only through building of trust between the project staff and families of community\r\n\r\nNoting these achievements the following organizational learning’s have been recognized\r\n\r\n		\r\n·	This community has been difficult to work with due to \r\n1.   The depressed economics leading to dire hardships – the members of the community often-live short term rather than looking towards what will help in the future.\r\n2.	The community as a whole has a very rigid belief system, which does not easily allow for outsiders to intervene.\r\n3.	There is a general concern of the intentions of organizations claiming to offer help to the inhabitants of the community.\r\n\r\n·	Education is exceptionally difficult to offer because the general lifestyle of the community families requires a certain degree of flexibility , allowing a degree of freedom. Continuity in class attendance does not fit their norms and habits.\r\n\r\n·	Because there is so much distrust of outside agencies and governmental agencies in particular, a great deal of effort had to go towards building people trust in order to persuade them to take advantage of the resources Asmaan is facilitating. \r\n\r\n\r\n·	The way of making contact with community members required learning.\r\n         It was discovered that the most effective relationships involved.\r\n1.	Several home visits and development of one –to –one relationships \r\n2.	Explanations of the additional, immediate benefits of entrusting the children’s time and presence to us (i.e., nutrition, medical care) in addition to the long-term gains of the education offered through the balwadi and support classes.\r\n3.	Salient mobilization of other agencies on behalf of the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith these achievements and learnings in mind, Project Asmaan refined its vision.\r\nThe overriding goals of the project remain to ensure that the community meets the basic rights of the child and empowering women in decision-making. This will be achieved via three objectives:\r\n·	Ensure that the rights of the child to protection, development, and participation are met to reduce vulnerability so that they are able to access better options in life.\r\n·	Empower woman in the community to participate in decision-making.\r\n·	Build links with various institutions, government departments, etc. so that the community is able to fulfill its own needs.\r\nIn addition to above objectives the project aims in:\r\n·	Preventing economic exploitation of girls / children.\r\n·	Provide girls with information regarding prevention of abuse.\r\n·	Build links with police and organizations involved in issues of trafficking, abuse, etc.\r\n·	Develop groups of women and focus on adolescent girls.\r\nFor achieving these above mentioned objectives- the team has  proposed some activity. \r\n \r\nActivities to be carried on:\r\n1.	School Admission for Children, especially girls\r\n2.	Regularity of Support Classes and Balwadi\r\n3.	Exploring existing crèches, Scheme for women\r\n4.	Sponsorship/ support for education\r\n5.	Arranging meetings with parents and School teachers\r\n6.	Periodic health check ups\r\n7.	Training for health animators to monitor health status of the community\r\n8.	To provide information to the adolescent girls regarding prevention of sexual abuse\r\n9.	Exploring vocational courses for adolescent girls\r\n10.	To form women saving groups\r\n11.	To network with others NGOs working on similar issues\r\n\r\nThis is possible only if a one to one relationship through daily visits and interaction with community has to be maintained. \r\n', 'Saathi and CCDT (Commited Community Development Trust)', 'We want to tell you something about SAATHI.

This donation provides these children with the means to meet their basic needs and gives them them hope for a brighter future. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information about Shastri School, please refer to the History section where you can find detailed site reports on visits from project stewards as well as the latest updates on the school. \r\n\r\nTo learn more about the children of Shastri School and see which children are still in need of sponsorship please visit:[<a href="http://www.ashanet.org/projects-new/documents/176/ShastriStudentProfiles_Aug2010.doc">Support A Child Details</a>]\r\n\r\nIf interested in sponsoring a child or learning more about the school, please email us, Sruthi Ramakrishnan and Swathi Ramakrishnan at swaruthi@aol.com. You will be amazed what a difference you can make in a child''s life through a very nominal monthly contribution, in furthering their education and providing them hope for a brighter future.

The funding requested is a total of $30,545 ($13,345 for 2003-04 and $16,900 for the second year).

This organization came into existence due to an interaction between Urmul Trust (started by Sanjay Ghosh) and the Dalit weavers. During the 1987 drought, the severest in recent years, Sanjoy Ghosh (who was abducted by the ULFA in Assam in 1997) set up self-reliant co-operatives across the desert with Urmul, the voluntary organisation he founded. He went looking for weavers who could utilise the roomfuls of excess wool following the relief programme and found himself at Phaludi, 160 km from Bikaner. \r\n\r\nThe weavers here belong to the Meghwal caste, the lowest in the hierarchy. Those days they used to just about survive, making shawls using traditional motifs. They would then travel to the interiors to sell their labour of love, while working for the rich farmers’ to pay off ancient debts. \r\n\r\nFive tentative weavers took the first step. They set up a design venture with Urmul’s help. Gradually, they set up a chain of educational and health centres, which has now become the lifeline of the region. \r\n\r\nIn the beginning UMBVS concentrated their work around the development of weavers and their families, but in 1994 a malaria epidemic broke out in the region, and the organization immediately expanded their area of work: forgetting about their target group, they helped to get medical aid to thousands of people.\r\n\r\nFrom then the organization decided to expand their area of work and increase their target group. It now helps women, children and dalits who are economically, socially and politically backward.

Asha for Education, LA has been working toward improving the Government schools.', 'Orissa is one of the most economically challenged states in India. Asha for Education, LA has been working toward improving the Government schools at Bilana, Rahania Sahi, Itagadi, Tulashipur and Kubera, five villages in Bhadrak district, a rural area 100km north of Bhubaneswar. Situated in an area with no electricity, the schools provide a valuable service to the community. Some of these schools have been operating since the turn of the last century. \r\nThis project was brought to Asha''s attention by Dr. Deepak Nayak who grew up in Bhadrak. When Asha LA volunteers first visited these schools in 1993, the schools had dilapidated black boards, very few teaching aids, and only two teachers instructing all six grades. The first contribution of $800 provided for new black-boards, chairs, desks, benches, books, world maps, paper, and other basic utilities for the 560 children. \r\n\r\nThe schools also faced a severe shortage of teachers. With overpopulation and understaffing the teacher to student ratio was around 1 to 100. Usually, one teacher was hired by the government to handle 5 grades at Rs 3000 ($100) per month (in 1993). Asha-LA has hired 6 additional teachers thereby doubling the number of teachers. It must be noted that the unemployed graduates from the villages competed for these new posts though the salary was only Rs 600 ($20) per month. Two of these teachers are women and they seem to have the best rapport with the children. Deepak Nayak''s mother, who was a respected head of the village, helped with on-site management. \r\n\r\nOne of the students being assisted with a special scholarship is Sanjulata Jena. She was the first woman to ever pass the 10th grade from her so-called lower caste community. She has also been provided with a bicycle and encouraged to take up higher education instead of sewing. Ever since Asha-LA got involved, these villages have come alive with renewed vitality. \r\n\r\nIn 1999, Asha LA started book-banks in these schools. Each school bought 10-20 sets of text books (1-5 grades) and the poorest children borrow these for free. At the end of the year, they return the books to the school and these books become the property of the schools. This cost approximately Rs 18000. In 2000, Asha-LA provided the salaries for 7 teachers (Rs. 800 per month per teacher, $1800 per year) and teaching aids such as chalk, black-boards, maps, science instruments, stools, tables, etc. ($200).\r\n\r\nIn 2001 and 2002, Asha for Education assisted in the construction of the Itagari M.

A group of socially committed individuals came forward to fill this void by starting ASTITVA.\r\n\r\n\r\nConsidering the scale and magnitude of the undertaking, it was decided to execute the task in phases starting with the school for the mentally retarded.

The education and training of these children differs a lot from that of normal children, often requiring person specific programmes.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we have 135 mentally retarded children in the age group 4- 18 years.

We need contributions for surgery and subsequent acquisition of factors for both the boys on a monthly basis. Monthly requirement for each boy is $62/- per month. The support ($62 per month per child) covers cost of factors, medicines, health & nutritional supplement, transportation (whole) to school.\r\nAnother help that is required is to contact hospitals willing to donate expired factors for use in India. Currently nearly expired or expired factors are being used to treat patients with Hemophilia in India since the medication is completely unaffordable otherwise. These will be hospitals in the US, which destroy factors which almost reach their expiry dates. Such factors can still be used in our case. \r\n\r\n<b><a name="Hemophilia and Associated Joint Problem">Hemophilia and Associated Joint Problem</a></b>\r\n\r\nHemophilia (or Haemophilia) is a rare (one in 5000 males) but life-long genetic blood disorder. It is X-chromosome linked - while females are its carriers, it is males who suffer from it. However, it is not always hereditary and can appear in an individual without Hemophilia history in his lineage due to mutations. People with hemophilia have tendency for extensive  bleeding - they don?t bleed more or faster than anyone else but they do bleed longer.\r\n\r\nWhen we hurt ourselves we need certain proteins (They are called Factors and are numbered) to stop the bleeding. A person with hemophilia doesn''t have enough of one Factor (less than 1% whereas normal varies between 50% and 150%). Hemophilia Type A means there is not enough of Factor 8 (75% cases) and Type B means not enough of Factor 9(25% cases). When a blood vessel gets broken, blood leaks out from it. When the cut is small a protein called Von Willebrand''s Factor and tiny cells called platelets are enough to stop the bleed. When the damage is larger then all the other  Factors (like Factor 8) are needed to form a stronger and  bigger plug.  So for small cuts, the bleeding stops even for people with Hemophilia. For larger bleeds the current medical  treatment is to externally inject the Factor that is missing for Hemophiliacs (or Hemophilics). Bleeding can happen anywhere but it happens mostly  in the joints and muscles.  When the joint bleed occurs the membrane  present in the joint capsule produces a digestive enzyme that eats away the trapped blood. However, the enzyme does not differentiate between blood and cartilage (smooth covering at the end of bones in the joint) and starts eating away the cartilage along with blood stuck to the bone-ends. When some cartilage is gone, the bone ends are not smooth - this can pinch or tear the membrane creating more bleeds and more enzyme! Soon all the cartilage is eaten up causing the bones to rub together - this hurts a lot. When not treated in time this can make joints immobile and end up causing crippling disabilities.\r\n\r\nWhen bleeding begins, hemophiliacs first feel a tingling  or bubbling sensation at the joint which then turns into pain. Before being given a Factor injection, as first aid they should be immediately give ice-pack treatment, the joint immobilized and ideally be given a crutch to move around. Hemophiliacs are advised to avoid playing contact sports like Kabadi and Soccer.', 'Kevempu Trust / Bharati Trust', '', '', 'http://', '', 0x30, 'bharathitrust@yahoo.com', '', 1, '', '', 1792, '', 13, 29, 2, '', '', '', 1, NULL, 'This project began by supporting two children with hemophilia - Rudra and Santosh.

The school follows the State syllabus and books.  The teaching methodology is different from the methods followed in conventional schools. The school imparts strict discipline and very high academic standards. The student-to-teacher ratio is less than 1:10 and this actually helps the teachers closely monitor the progress of each child and help them build upon their strengths and overcome weaknesses. The teachers try to identify the innate potential of each child by paying attention to each child and monitoring his/her progress. In addition, the school provides two sets of uniforms, nutritious lunch, medical check ups and medicines, a late afternoon glass of milk and bus transportation for students not living within walking distance. The management conducts parent-teacher meetings every month to discuss the problems both parties have and provide guidance to arrive at effective solutions. Most parents have also realized the value of education their children receive by going to Sarada Vidyalayam and their conventional outlook towards education has changed.\r\n\r\nApart from this, the kids take yoga classes twice a week, from a professional yoga teacher. All the children have been given three doses of Hepatitis-B vaccinations. Dr. Indira Gadhiraju from Ottawa, Canada, conducted dental checkups. A local dentist, Dr.M.Bhaskar volunteered to do the necessary follow-up work free of charge for the children. The school provides opportunities for its senior grade (six and seven) children to participate in science fairs conducted by local schools in Kakinada. The children are also taught art and craft, using readily available materials like seeds,coir,waste plastic and other inexpensive household items. This activity teaches children the significance of objects they see daily, as well as inculcating in them the idea of recycling.\r\n\r\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS \r\n\r\nWe are very proud to announce that all the children who have graduated from 7th Grade have joined in High schools, some in Gurukula schools and others in local High schools. Those former students who have completed 10th class have joined in colleges. One student has cleared the entrance examination to polytechnic with a good rank and has gotten admission in the local Government Polytechnic College.   There were no dropouts from the students who attended Sarada Vidyalayam. Every single student who has entered Sankurathri school has successfully completed 7th grade and passed the state exam with first class (60%). All of these students have gone on to continue their high school education. For the last few years, all the students from Grade 7 have been encouraged and trained to take the entrance examinatin for admission into Grade 8 at Andhra Pradesh Residential Schools, which are popularly known as Gurukula schools. These Gurukula schools are well structured, disciplined and known for their excellent academic standards and results. \r\n\r\nOur efforts so far have been very fruitful. All the children who are attending these schools, and their parents, are extremely happy about being admitted into these schools. We hope to continue the effort in order to enable the children face the challenges of life. \r\n<!--\r\nIt would be really nice to find sponsors for all the children at the school.

The teachers at Vikasana were deeply inspired by David''s work. The basic philosophy is that anyone at any level could learn what one was interested in. There was no competition or comparison - a child could learn at his pace. Education means learning - it can be enjoyable. This opportunity should be given to children who have no access to system education, like village children. Thus emerged Vikasana, Vi-ka-sa-na is the correct pronunciation. It means blossoming, opening up, spreading. Vikasna wishes that Learning...Mind...Life should blossom , grow and spread.\r\n\r\n<b>Working of the Centre</b>\r\n \r\nThe centre starts activities at 8:30 am. All the children are entrusted with duties like caring for the trees and cleaning the rooms, the surroundings, providing drinking water etc. Then the children assemble to attend singing. They sing songs in many languages such as Kannada, English, Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Bengali, French, German and Italian. Later they do Yoga specially designed for children. Academic classes and handicrafts finish at 5 pm. Lunch break is from 1 pm to 2 pm. Some children also stay back at the centre to do their homework. The centre provides accommodation and supper.\r\n \r\n<b>Examinations</b>\r\n \r\nThe children who are interested in taking the government level exams at the 7th standard and S.S.L.C level are given the necessary help by way of coaching and enrolling them as private candidates in a govt. school. Those who do not wish to sit for such exams are encouraged to develop their talents. Help is also provided to them by other voluntary organizations such as Aurobindo Ashram, Delhi, Akruti and Mrichakatika in Bangalore. So far eight children have taken the S.S.L.C exam and are continuing their education at various levels. They keep in contact with the centre for further guidance. Two girls are employed as designers in pottery units. One girl is currently teaching at the centre\r\n \r\n<b>Method of Working</b>\r\n \r\nThe children learn to read and write three languages. Other than subjects like Mathematics, Science  and environmental studies, they learn handicrafts such as pottery , carpentry, sewing, origami, drawing, painting etc. Handicrafts is not only taught as a subject but is integrated into their daily process. Children make pots out of clay, they paint murals on the walls of the school, make pots and build kilns. They also sew bags and dresses for themselves, build and repair buildings, make tables and shelves for their classrooms. Children also grow flowers and vegetables. There is a library at the centre for children of all ages.\r\n \r\nThe children are encouraged and motivated and not to compete and compare. Hope is that children will learn through games and activities along with the books and materials. \r\n \r\nWednesday''s are special days for the children.

Ultimately if the community is responsible for the school, that is the best way to ensure that the school functions well.

The majority population in Kanhangad falls under low-income earners or medium income earners. The literacy level is also on the lower side and hence most parents are ignorant of the problems faced by their child. A mentally handicapped child is thus considered more of a burden in many households. When the land was donated to the Rotary Club, they decided to use it for a good cause and decided to have a school for the mentally retarded children. Over the years, the institution has grown from strength to strength and as on date, it is one of the most reputed special schools in this region. The school is currently having strength of 65 children with eleven teaching staff and four non-teaching staff. Children attending the school are mostly from economically backward families. Many were not getting adequate attention to their problems from the family because of the ignorance of the parents. They are usually mild to severe affected children. However, the children show remarkable improvement in all aspects after started attending the school. \r\n\r\nRSSMRC takes care of all the educational needs for the children. They also provide the children with one-time meals and conveyance from their home to school. The school also provides them with health care, as there is no institute dedicated to meet the special needs of the children and provide them with some training to be able to support themselves.\r\n\r\nThe school provides them with a in house doctor and a well equipped physiotherapy clinic', 'Rotary MBM Charitable Trust - Dr Nambiar.', 'Dr Nambiar is the chair person of the Rotary MGM charitable trust along with few other board of directors.

A person who cannot afford an operation or medicines is often seen at Dr Nambiarâ€™s hospital being cared for all his needs. \r\n\r\nDr Nambiar started this Rotary School with a noble thought of helping the mentally retarded kids.

Before GURIA started the Balwadi 90% of the children remained exposed to the surroundings of the red light area and also contributed a bit by bringing pan, tea, etc. for the customers. Even today only 20% of the work seems done since there are number of exposed children who need to be motivated. There are several schools around the redlight area but the mothers are ignorant and are difficult to be motivated. This also happens because the middlemen do not attest to the work done by Guria because of economic interests. There are almost 300 women and hundreds of family members. Mothers and children also have to face social ostracism which keeps them busy from the schools in the vicinity. \r\nThe goal of the project is to construct a night shelter for the already ongoing balwadi cum non-formal education centre in the red light area (shivdaspur) for children of women in prostitution. It enables Guria to begin late night tuitions for the school going children (atleast 50 children) because it becomes difficult to followup the children who return late in the evening from school.

Under the humanitarian vision of Ajeet Singh, several volunteers have been working for over a decade aiming to mainstream these workers, especially their children.\r\n\r\nBy educating their children and assisting them in entering mainstream schools and careers the second generation prostitution can be reduced and even averted. By channeling spare time of the prostitutes into handicrafts and cultural programs,  Guria offers a lucrative alternative and life choice.

The aim is to restore dignity and rebuild humanity and self-esteem.\r\n\r\nVISION: End of forced prostitution & creation of a humane world where all beings co-exist in harmony with the entire creation.\r\n\r\nMISSION: Education to children & rehabilitation, end child prostitution, stop second generation prostitution in Varanasi UP\r\n', 'Guria Swayam Sevi Sansthan', 'Guria has come a long way since itï¿½s origin in 1993, which came about through the adoption of three children of women in prostitution (WIP) at Shivdaspur (Red Light Area ), Varnasi U.P.

It also serve as as the base for the immediate legal and medical requirements for the children and women in prostitution(especially STDs/HIV/AIDS awareness, referral cases and weekly doctor''s visit). The balwadi helps in grooming up children (between the age group of 3 to 5 years) to be admitted to the regular formal schools instead of an exclusive school(isolation ward) for the children of WIP. Children should be allowed to join the mainstream by interacting with various sections of children to get exposed to the outer world and investigate pros and cons for themselves instead of Guria giving them sermons of morality. The NFE centre caters to the children who cannot attend formal schools. The children are occupied in play activities, concept formation, personality development, value education, counseling, hobby classes (music,art drama) and are taken out for picnic..etc. \r\n\r\nGuria Festival: Apart from awareness, the first ever festival of WIP is also an important means of rehabilitation through their ready made classical and folk song and dance traditions-drawing minimum suspicious eye from the vested interests. Moreover they have been keepers of traditional form of music and dance in this era of extinction which has survived since ages. In this era of various T.V. Channels, orchestra the demand for the traditional music is dwindling at a very rapid pace-thus putting pressure on the source of their livelihood and substituting it with the increasing demand for flesh trade. \r\n\r\nTheir talent was attested by B.B.C.

In the early days the focus was on improving the quality of science education. Over time, through various literacy campaigns, TNSF has been involved in large scale mobilization for adult literacy. TNSF have brought out a large amount of materials for neo-literates which are being used across the state. They have also diversified into health education, legal literacy and education for Self Help Groups. Another important educational intervention has been the development of modules for work based education in such fields as animal husbandry, hand pump repair, silk rearing, agriculture.\r\n\r\nThey run a monthly science magazine for children in Tamil (Thulir) and a bi-monthly magazine in English (Jantar Mantar). TNSF are also nvolved in teacher training and children''s science clubs (Thulir Illams). In the early 90''s, a large campaign called the Joy of Learning (JoL) Campaign was initiated. This focused on the need to make schools child-friendly and on the use of games and activities in the teaching/learning process. This state wide campaign was very successful and put pressure on the government to take action accordingly. Finally when the DPEP programme of the government was taken up, JoL was an important part of the programme and the tools/materials developed by the TNSF for its campaigns were brought into use in the schools. The JoL campaign was launched after a study in 1991 by TNSF which highlighted the following:\r\n- In villages where there are no organized avenues of child labour, most of\r\nthe drop-outs at primary level occur due to a combination of children''s\r\ndisinterest in school, their academic failure and lack of parental\r\nmonitoring\r\n-  If dropped-out children are not put back into school within a very short\r\nspan of time, it becomes progressively more difficult to do so.\r\n- An environment where most parents send their children to\r\nschool encourages those that donâ€™t to follow suit.\r\n- In many cases children are required to assist their families in generating economic activity even if for a few hours during the day. In the current scenario, such absenteeism is not allowed.\r\nIn addition to JoL, a programme to monitor drop-outs and enrol them back into school was developed and tried out in a few blocks which good success. In child labour intensive areas like Sivakasi and Kancchipuram, TNSF has been running Non-Formal Education Centers for working children. In Latheri, TNSF has also been running a model school which entirely uses activity based learning.

Use by the visually impaired among the disabled implies that the modules must be voice-enabled.\r\n(c)	Programmes must proceed from what may be called a “broad-band” approach, of combining multiple related modules and addressing multiple related objectives within single programmes, which would incidentally mean better returns on the same infrastructure investments. \r\n(d)	Training in the use of the modules should be handled by a local facilitator, who should be provided with a computer, with the relevant software modules and also special training in their effective use of both the hardware and software. Large numbers of cutting edge grass root functionaries – teachers, health workers, welfare workers, volunteers etc – from both Governmental and Non-Governmental organisations must be so trained and equipped  to become far more effective facilitators than they are today, in the delivery of the whole range of social welfare services. \r\n\r\nVidya Vrikshah has developed and implemented  a wide range of applications and activities of socio-economic relevance and significance based upon the IIT’s Multilingual Software Package, with the help of  volunteers drawn mainly from housewives and senior citizens of the community.

This Project  involves the establishment of a network of Vikas Training Centres to promote  Village Development  on the integrated approach described above, by providing  computers, relevant software modules and training in their use to  teachers, health workers and welfare workers  in  Schools and a Self-Help Groups in each of village. Three NGOs – Relief Foundation, Mentors, and Vidya Vrikshah have come together to implement this Project in an organised way. Vikas Training Centres have already been set up in the last three months in 12 locations (as of 01-03-2003)  in Chennai, and Kanchipuram, Tiruvallur and Vellore Districts, and another 6 centres are programmed in the next two months.

It covers a population of approximately 30,000 people. The settlements themselves are much larger and Sahyogï¿½s reach is also widening. The population is predominantly poor, largely migrant and belongs to the backward castes (both Hindu and Muslim). About 80 percent of the population is Muslim. The literacy rate (in 1997) for women was only 60 percent, which is much below the city''s average. Most of the people here are employed as casual or informal sector workers, having very unstable income and no social security.

Established in June 2000, this is a community-based school for out-of-school adolescent girls. It uses a learning-through-doing methodology, through which in addition to classroom teaching, we involve girls in community work, action research, mapping, etc. The primary aim of Sahyogï¿½s school is to give these girls confidence in themselves and develop their capacity for critical thinking. Sahyog also offers the girls opportunity to link with the formal system at the 3rd, 5th, 8th and 10th std through the Open Schooling system. In 2004, the first batch of girls cleared the school leaving examinations (17 girls). Over the years, more than 300 girls have passed through Sahyog and each year, on average, enrolment doubles. Currently, its two branches have about 50 girls each. \r\n\r\nÂ·  Sangharsh Special Education Program Sangharsh is a community-based rehabilitation and training program that started in the Jari Mari slum areas of Mumbai. The program started in 2003 for poor families with children for special needs. It uses the abundant human resources that a slum can provide, but is low-cost and can be managed by local staff. Thus, with only two specialized teachers, the program is able to cater 25-30 children with different kinds of disability (currently predominantly students with mental retardation and hearing impairment). The local staff includes two assistants and five girls from the Sahyog girlsï¿½ school. Periodic trainings and assessment camps are organized to impart training to the local staff. Being located in the community, and through constant interaction with the families of the children, the program tries to develop awareness about their rights (their childrenï¿½s and their own). \r\n\r\nÂ·  Sahyog Ekta Started in 2003, the Sahyog Ekta community based health program was set up as a small clinic in both school locations through which access to basic health services are provided (maternal health, immunization, T.B treatment, contraceptive services, advice and counseling) in collaboration with the municipal corporation. This clinic also functions as a free school health clinic for all students of Sahyog.

They definitely need to improve their literacy and numeracy skills. They also have a thirst for information on all subjects. However, they also need to be treated like adults, who have adult problems. At the same time, they want the school to give them freedom and an opportunity to play, have fun and be themselves. Getting a degree is very often not the motivation for coming to school. \r\n	\r\nGiven this background and the fact that Sahyog works with girls who have very little support to continue schooling, the school has been designed that caters to their specific needs. \r\n\r\nThe aim of Sahyog Sangharsh is to teach disabled children to live independent and productive lives in their own society and community.\r\n\r\nSahyog''s also aims to improve access to basic health and education services, both by collaborating with existing organizations as well as increasing community awareness and mobilization.\r\n\r\nThe long-term objective of Sahyog is to create a secular, progressive and empowering space, which enables the development of a cadre of well-trained, socially committed young leaders.', '', '', 0x30, '', '', 2, '', '', 0, '', 23, 27, 2, '', '', '', 0, NULL, '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, '2011-03-14 02:15:56', '2003-06-04 16:41:00'),

The school, which, started with an open park setting of classes conducted under the shades of a tree was moved to a large rented building in 2006. The new exciting development in 2007 is the school''s alliance with Digital Study Hall (DSH), a global Microsoft Research project, centered in India, that records and distributes DVDs of classes led by the best grassroots teachers. The plan is to develop Prerana Shishu Vidyalaya (PSV) School into a recognized high school with its own premises and building. The bigger goal is to institutionalize the DSH methodology in PSV and then spread the benefit of it to other schools in the nearby region. We also plan to open more such schools in needy areas of the city. At the present rate about Rs.700/- per annum per student will be the approx. expenditure for running a centre.\r\n\r\nDETAILS\r\n\r\nThe running expenses of the school are Rs.153000/-. Donations from like minded individuals and an organisation named Arya Samaj Swaroop Nagar Seva Samiti have helped sustain the organization in the past.

These areas include (but are not limited to) problems with math teaching in primary schools, low cost science experiments, health education. Since the core group has limited time they are unable to reach out to enough villages without diluting the content. The VCDs were thought of a way to boost field programs and used as supplementation in the training program. \r\n\r\nThey can be used in group viewing, no only in teacher training programs but also by teachers in schools to enhance their teaching in class. The idea is not to replace the teacher or trainer. \r\n\r\nThe videos on specific classes eg Physics for VIII: It is not attempted to cover the entire book and put it on a video. From earlier experience and available material it is clear that this tends to overburden the students who already have to read the text. Instead, experimentation based techiniques are shown which clarify and get the children to ask questions about their understanding of the topics. The topics covered are chosen from experience from the "hot spots" that children in the past have encountered. \r\n\r\nPlease refer to the <a href="http://www.ashanet.org/nycnj/projects/tnsf/tnsfProp.pdf">proposal</a> for details on the VCDs that TNSF has resources to make at this point.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe program will be used in the 8 districts that TNSF has worked with in the past as well as the 100 blocks that the TNSF is extending a variety of programs to. \r\n\r\nTwo videos VCDs have already been made, one is the "Powers of 10 the atom to the universe". This is a 15 min video that introduces the children to scales of 10, starting with a leaf progressively zooms out by a scale of 10 times till it shows the entire universe. It then zooms in by a power of 10 each time till it reaches the atom. This video was demonstrated at a teachers meeting at Madurai and the VCDs were lapped up right there. I have shown this video to children at schools near Chennai and the response has been phenomenal. \r\n\r\nThe other video is "Childhood from birth to four". This explains the different sections of a children childhood. This was meant to be viewed by adolescent girls and women. The video gives an understanding of the requirements of mothers and children with special emphasis on addressing popular beliefs that cause a children to be malnourished in villages. \r\n\r\nThe video camera has been provided by AID (Associaltion of Indian Development) and the primary costs of making the videos is in editing and conversion to digital format. The editing is done in both the video stage and in the digital stage with video clipings, and animation are added to make the video more interesting to watch. \r\n\r\nOnce the first VCD is cut, it is distributed at the price of cutting a CD. (only around Rs.60, which is very affordable for a community) The difference in availability of VCDs with other educational materials lies in the fact that TNSF is non-profit organization and is not trying to make money of these VCDs and that the costs of building of the video are taken care of by Asha. ', 'AID-India and Tamil Nadu Science Forum', 'The Tamil Nadu Science Forum is a people''s movement that has been mobilizing and empowering the underprivileged to help themselves since the 1980. The Science movements, like many others movements tries to change the way the society thinks, in this case by giving a critical understanding of the science.\r\n\r\nThe society decides what kind of science is done, this is especially true of today when science is no longer a personal pursuit, but is in large part a social effort, directed and funded by governments eg. the decision that research in nuclear energy should be funded over research in solar energy or large dams should be built over smaller local water harvesting techinques.\r\nThe first agenda of the science movement has been to inform the common people on what science is being done, how and why i.e. to analyze policies, educate people and mobilizing public opinion on issues.\r\n\r\nThe group was started by research scientists from IIT and IISC who soon realized that critiquing the science policy and mobilizing people was not enough! They had to develop solutions that could be used by the common man. They developed alternate models in literacy, education, health, enterprises and agriculture. Through these models, it was attempted to restructure science learning techiniques. These techiniques were successfully demonstrated\r\nin a joy of learning school. This was followed by\r\ntraining teachers to use innovative teaching methods, training village women to use health information, training farmers to use science to improve soil. In short putting into practice the promise of science - improving living\r\nconditions of people.\r\n\r\nThe science movement also works towards the construction of a rational society by explaning natural phenomenon using science and countering irrational beliefs and superstitions. \r\n\r\nFrom 1989-1995 TNSF developed a mass literacy campaign in 8 districts, which reached out to 2000 villages, mobilized 20,000 teachers and 200,000 learners. Most of the lerners were women and with literacy came awareness and women participated in large numbers in anti-arrack(local liquor) agitations, learn bicycle campaigns, employment program and credit networks. The local vested interests (arrack shops, quarry contractors) and even the govt felt threatned. This led to the souring of the TNSF-Govt partnership and TNSF pulled out of the campaign.\r\n\r\nThe movements that had started however, continued. Each of the districts tried their own experiments on social development. Some of the more important ones were\r\n self-reliant saving schemes for women(Kanyakumari, Virudunagar), health training programs(Ramnad) - training volunteers to provide individual advice on children and\r\nwomen''s needs, enterprises for women(Madurai), quarry contracts for women groups(Pudukottai), working on school-drop outs(Villupuram and Cuddalore), activity based school(Vellore), support shelter for women victims of violence(Ramnad). A lot of experiments were conducted in these areas, some worked, some failed. Just as life evolves, ideas that worked started spreading.\r\n\r\nThe focus of TNSF is now to integrate and expand ideas that have worked. In education these are innovative teaching methods, libraries for women and rural IT centers. These ideas are being nurtured and spread to new blocks. These programs\r\nreach out and save thousands of children from malnutrition, dropping out of school, while helping lacs of women with credit and enterprise and health skills and helps farmers improve the soil and their yield.\r\n\r\nThe strength of TNSF lies in it''s ability to campaign on larger issues while at the same time demostrating how these ideas actually improve the lives of the poor, in their volunteers who take time out helping in schools, visiting villages, organizing programs, training and raising funds.\r\n\r\nFor more information on the TNSF please read the <a href="tnsf/tnsfIntro.pdf"> introduction document </a> of\r\nTNSF.\r\n\r\nThe VCD proposal is one of the new initiatives of a small but concrete resource that Asha can work on and own.

The miserable conditions of the slum dwellers, due to poverty and illiteracy, made a deep impact on the collective psyche of the members. Deeply moved by the plight of these slum dwellers the founder secretary of VEC, Mr. M. N. Murthy made up his mind to setup an institution named Vivekananda Public School (VPS) to provide educational facilities to the slum children. Since 1982 this school is imparting conventional education to the poor and the downtrodden children of slum localities.\r\n\r\nThe group is purely secular and non-religious. Students belonging to all religions are admitted and receive equal treatment from the institution. Students belonging to other states are also given admission and equally treated.\r\nCurrently there are two schools running under the VEC umbrella. One of them, VPS is located within Hyderabad city, while the other school Vivekananda Vidyalaya is located in a village outside the city. \r\n	\r\nVIVEKANANDA PUBLIC SCHOOL\r\nPlot No. 38, Journalists colony, Road No. 3\r\nBanjara Hills, Hyderabad\r\nAndhra Pradesh, INDIA.\r\n\r\nVIVEKANANDA VIDYALAYA\r\nAt rural village NANAKRAM GUDA, \r\nRangareddy district,\r\nAndhra Pradesh, INDIA.\r\n\r\nThere are a total of 75 boys and 61 girls between 3 and 14 years who are currently enrolled in the two schools run by VEC. There are 12 teachers (minimum qualification being an SSC) and two Ayahs at VPS. The school is housed in a rented pukka building with ten classrooms. The rent for the building is around rupees 10,000 per month.\r\n', 'Vivekananda Educational Center', 'Socio-economic background of parents:\r\n - Many of the parents depend on seasonal employment for their livelihood. Since their employment is not regular, their income is also uncertain.\r\n - Many of them are daily-wage earners, like masons, carpenters, rickshaw-pullers, watchmen, and domestic servants. As a result very few parents extend their meager contributions to the school. \r\n - Occasionally the school receives funds from private donors and philanthropists. Apart from this, the school used to get some funds from Lions Club in the past, though this has stopped in recent times because of a change in focus of the new management at Lions Club from primary education to health. \r\n\r\nWhy not Government Schools?\r\n - Government schools in the area are over crowded and the medium of instruction is Telugu. Several people living in the slums are migrants from other states and their mother tongue is not Telugu. Since VPS is an English medium school it is more useful to them. \r\n - With respect to standard of education, discipline, and proper care towards the students, parents find that the VPS system is better than that of the government school. Hence the parents prefer this school.\r\n - There is a Balwadi School nearby. But the school is imparting education only up to 4th class and the medium of instruction is Telugu. Students whose mother tongue is other than Telugu do not normally seek admission into this school. \r\n\r\nPast Students from the school and efforts to help them with their future:\r\n - About 150 students passed out of the school, during the past five years. Some of these students are studying higher education like Intermediate or pursuing a Bachelorï¿½s degree. Some are undergoing apprenticeship training in various firms. Some are employed in private firms. \r\n - Members of VEC conduct counseling and guidance to the parents and students. They are advised on how to apply for job-oriented courses and how to build their future career.\r\n - The students are also provided help by arranging financial assistance through private donors, Lions Club and other such agencies depending upon the requirements.\r\n\r\nNon-education related community development activities:\r\n - VEC members conduct community health camps both in urban and rural areas.\r\n - They also conduct awareness programs relating to health and hygiene, sanitation, childcare etc.\r\n - They are involved in prevention of child labour and bonded labour and also problems of street children.\r\n - They are organizing and promoting self-employment groups in rural areas.\r\n\r\nInteraction with parents:\r\n - The school conducts parents-teachers meetings to appraise the progress of their wards. \r\n - Teachers frequently visit the families from which the students come to appraise them about the importance of giving good education to their children. \r\n - Since most of the parents are uneducated they canï¿½t participate in discussions as such and the teachers take the personal responsibility to appraise them about the problems relating to them.\r\n', ' - To promote literacy among the illiterates.\r\n - To provide educational facilities especially to the slum dwellers and other downtrodden communities by establishing primary and high school level schools.\r\n - To provide vocational training facilities (to the students) by introducing courses like typewriting, tailoring, painting, drawing, and other low-cost technical courses. \r\n - Computer education is also a part of vocational training programs planned for the future.', '', '', 0x30, '', 'asha-cnj@yahoogroups.com', 2, 'Plot No 38; Journalist Colony', 'Road No:-3; Banjara Hills', 0, '', 5, 28, 2, '', '', '', 0, NULL, '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, '2006-09-12 03:27:37', '2004-07-08 20:57:21'),

Contextually, Jeeva Jyothi?s (JJ) work is intertwined with the fate met by many poor rural farmers in India.  Facing severe water shortage or assault on crop prices, they sell their land (if they own) and migrate to cities.  They arrive disoriented, their luggage heavy with superstitious ways and caste oppression, yet empty of literacy and skills.  The result is searching for odd day-labour jobs, surviving in slums, or trapped as bonded labour.  Against this complex social problem JJ aims at children, clearly the helpless victims, their legitimate rights violated often through ignorance of parents and society.  These children, robbed of child-hood and basic human rights, suffer through 10+ hour workdays, sleeping on streets, no schooling, inadequate nutrition, and regular abuse and exploitation.

It was closed in 1939 around the time of the second world-war and reopened in 1943 soon after the Bengal famine. The focus then was on providing shelter to women and children adversely affected by the famine. After the Bengal partition in 1947, refugee women and children were sent to the Home from government camps. Vocational coaching was provided to the older women, and children were sent to schools. Resettlement into houses in the outskirts of Calcutta followed. In 1949, new premises were provided by the Government and a maternity centre was started for refugee unmarried mothers from Pakistan who were largely victims of the riots. In 1950, the Home for children was started to provide shelter and care for children of destitute women.

Each integrated center is intended to comprise of 1 Kindergarten (individual) center for children between 4 to 6 years, 1 Primary Education Center (PEC) for children between 6 to 12 years, and 1 Coaching Center for children in Class 9th and 10th. In some cases, the 3 individual centers cannot be "integrated" into the same village, but are nearby villages. The 9 individual centers supported by Asha, are spread across 7 total villages (See Additional Comments section below). This is based on the availability of the teachers as well as the level of demand at these villages. Also, older children are more capable of traveling further for education than are the younger children. \r\n\r\nEach center is run by a woman entrepreneur and teacher who will provide supplementary education to between 25 and 40 children in their age group. These supplementary education sessions run 3 hours outside of school hours 5 days of the week. The women are expected to spend at least 4 hours of the day dedicated towards this with extra hours on at least 1 weekend day. If the women choose to take on a second batch, provided there is enough demand, each woman could be occupied 6 days a week, 8-10 hours each day in this effort. The women are trained to follow a creative curriculum and are provided ongoing support and materials by Hippocampus. The children currently enrolled in Government (or other schools) receive the resources and attention they need in order to pass the SSLC''s. The education they receive at these centers transcends the typical texts and information they receive at their formal schools.\r\n\r\nAsha''s one-time support goes towards center infrastructure costs, electric fittings, lights, mats, chalkboard etc. \r\n\r\nThe women take an initial microfinance loan (of Rs 10,000 each) to pay for the costs of their own selection, training and ongoing monitoring and mentorship they will each receive. These microfinance schemes are typically from Grameen Bank at a 20% interest rate, repayable over 2 years. Asha has chosen to fund the loan amounts for each teacher, so that both the principal and the interest that the teachers pay may be re-invested into education for the area rather than become profit for Grameen Bank. \r\n\r\nOnce the center opens, each child will pay a registration fee (Rs 500 for individual materials and a Hippocampus bag), as well as monthly fees (Rs 60 to Rs 120) each which forms the basis of the teacher''s salary. It is out of this salary that she supports the ongoing and recurring costs for their individual centers. Any costs during the first 3 years of operation are expected to be taken care of by the woman business owner / teacher.\r\n\r\nAbout 20% of children in the village will be likely to need scholarships to pay for their tuition. Asha is currently not supporting such scholarship, but would like to consider this for the future for the 9 centers that Asha is funding.\r\n\r\nThis project is expected to impact 240 to 315 children. If the teacher takes on a second batch, the total impact could be on 630 children. For the funding total of approximately $6000, this works out to be $9.5 to $25 for each child, as a one time investment.

The children who have passed through these programmes have become more aware of their rights and many of them have themselves started to participate in the initiatives to eradicate bonded labour.', 'The primary purpose of Jeevika is to eradicate Bonded Labour from Karnataka and, to this end, to rescue children from labour. The aim is to provide these children with an environment that enables them to build confidence, skills and literacy. Once the children reach a level where they can benefit from the formal education, they are placed into government schools and their progress monitored. The goals of the programme are detailed below:\r\n	\r\n1. To identify children who do not go to school or whose education has been discontinued. To seek the support of parents and work in conjunction with local authorities in order to put a stop to child labour.\r\n2. To bring children into â€˜boarding centresâ€™ where they are nurtured: provided food, shelter and, most importantly, the company of other children.   Residence in these boarding centres ensures that these children are protected from being forced back into agricultural labour. \r\n3. To train and monitor children and bring them to an appropriate level that allows them to fit into the formal education system. The bridge course does not offer formal education, as we understand it.  A greater emphasis is placed on instilling self-confidence into children and on encouraging children to express themselves.  \r\n4. To make every effort to enrol children into Government Schools, usually after a yearâ€™s stint in the â€˜back to school centresâ€™. In the majority of cases, once these children are put into the Government school, Jeevika activists also ensure that these children reside in Government welfare hostels so that they are able to continue with their education. \r\n5. To involve the parents of children who go through these programmes.  In a majority of cases, the parents of these children contact Jeevika to enrol their children in these programmes.  Jeevikaâ€™s awareness campaigns on Child Labour are specifically aimed to increase the awareness of parents about the rights and opportunities open to their Children.', '', '', 0x30, 'jeevika@vsnl.com', '', 1, '', '', 2901, '', 19, 29, 2, '', '', '', 0, NULL, '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 87, 293, NULL, NULL, 87, 293, NULL, NULL, 'Jeevika', 0, '2009-09-28 07:16:53', '2004-05-21 11:05:29'),

To make this dream come true, they bought 12 acres of land in the Dharmapuri district, dug bore wells, and built a house of their own in 1994. The next five years were spent in making the rocky piece of land cultivable. They planted trees, trained themselves in biological pest management and started practising self-sustaining organic farming of rice, ragi and jowar. The school Puvidham was started in 1999 and has been steadily growing in strength. The school started with seven children (two of whom were children of Meenakshi and Umesh).  Most children came from the villages of Kalani Kattur and Avvai Nagar and a few from Savalukkuttai and Kuduppatti. Within a mere 10 years, the school gained so much support and appreciation from the community, that they now have 96 student, with 56 children in the hostel!\r\n\r\nMission\r\n1)	Providing primary school education to children of migrant workers, and providing hostel facilities to as many children as possible.\r\n2)	Imparting education to government school drop outs and children from the National Child Labour Prevention Program, who have been unable to cope with the pressures of formal schooling, with the intention of helping them join regular schools after Class VIII. Many of their students join without even a basic knowledge of the alphabet, or have been out of the educational system for many years disillusioned by the rigid schooling at government schools.\r\n3)	Giving the children a working knowledge of Tamil and English and a strong foundation in Mathematics, and getting them familiar with farming activities.\r\n\r\nMethodology/ Niche/ What sets them apart?\r\n1)	Puvidham believes in holistic learning and seeks to improve self confidence of children who have been out of the educational system for many years.\r\n2)	Science, Art, Language and Math are all mixed in the same class!\r\n3)	Tamil and English are introduced simultaneously.  Often in their books, the same text is given both in Tamil and English!\r\n4)	Children are taught the importance of nature and the relevance of farming to their lives. \r\n5)	The children are placed in classes according to age. Activities vary from one age group to another. The younger children enjoy clay jigsaw puzzles, pronunciation games and nursery rhymes. The older children are taught Science, Social Science and Mathematics and engage in farming related activities such as drawing of village maps, making weather vanes, sun dials, designing better tools for plantation, experimental farming on small plots of land etc.\r\n6)	Teaching is done creatively. English and Tamil are taught through language flash cards. Maths is taught through the abacus, counting on stringed beads and Montessori like learning aids.\r\n7)	Importance is given to creative extracurricular activities like clay modelling, drawing, conducting puppet shows, stitching etc.\r\n8)	Story telling is considered important to give each child the confidence to speak.\r\n9)	Children are encouraged to help at home and are taught about their responsibilities to their families, so that the parents don’t lose out on helping hands at home. Unlike at government schools, students are not penalised for missing a few days because of work at home.\r\n10)	The teachers are also from the Dharampuri district from similar backgrounds, so they empathise better with the children.\r\n\r\nRecent activities of students/ teachers (updates)\r\n1)	Hostel building structure completed in May 2009. Projected completion end of this year for use in winter.\r\n2)	Teachers received training to orient curriculum towards farming, bring science into the classroom, teach children basic sewing activities and practice conversational English (April and May 2009).\r\n3)	Class 8 students went on a trek to Ooty with teachers, their first real experience in a forest.\r\n4)	35 students are karate enthusiasts and take regular lessons.\r\n5)	30 children and 6 teachers went on a tour of Tamil Nadu to learn more about the diverse culture of the state and appreciate the importance of environmental conservation.\r\n\r\nSuccess Stories\r\n1)	Out of the first 4 children who finished school in 2005, two have now been successfully integrated in government schools and are in their final year, one is working, and the fourth (a girl) is married and wants to work as a teacher in Puvidham.  \r\n2)	In September, 19 students between the ages of 12 yrs and 14 yrs left Puvidham to join mainstream government schools.

A ten classroom school building\r\n2.	A training Center\r\n3.	Dining Hall\r\n4.	Hostel Building\r\n5.	Library/Braille Transcription Center\r\n6.	Furniture for above; and kitchen equipment.\r\nAfter discussions with Mathru, and based on the priorities of their needs, Asha-CNJ decided in April 2004 to fund the construction of the school building.\r\n The school was started in 2001 in temporary and makeshift premises. Every year one grade was added. By 2004 grades 1 through 4 were operational. The goal was to have a 10 grade school in 2010. With a 10 room building built first, Mathru could use the extra space for training ï¿½ computer, music etc.- and transcription activities. It is hoped that as the classrooms are progressively occupied each year, funds would be solicited and become available for the remaining five purposes.\r\nThe land for the school and the other buildings was given to Mathru by the local government in recognition of its activities and community support. Within two months of Asha-CNJï¿½s decision to fund the school, i.e. in June 2004, Mathru submitted a professional architects plans and estimate for construction of the school building. At the same time a master plan showing the layout of the school along with the two centers, the hostel and the dining/kitchen facilities was also submitted.\r\nAsha-CNJ is the first organization located outside India solicited by Mathru.

Ms. G. R. Muktha, the managing trustee lost her foot in an accident when she was 22 years old and studying for a postgraduate degree.  Her own disability inspired and motivated her to help other disabled individuals. She decided to help the blind, created the trust and started the residential school in Yelahanka, Bangalore District to educate and rehabilitate visually impaired children. Ms. Muktha is a practicing lawyer, teaches at a college and is the editor of the Lawyers Lawbook. \r\n\r\nAt present, there are 42 students studying in grades 1, 2, 3 and 4. Mathru plans to add a grade every year until grade 10 is reached in 2010. The school is recognized by the Government of Karnataka. The children are also given food, clothing and health care. They are from poor families, born generally of illiterate parents who work in the fields and/or are daily wage earners from the surrounding semi-urban and village communities. Besides a formal education following the CBSE syllabus, the children are trained in music, art and drama at the Academy associated with the school. A computer with the appropriate software is available to give computer training. A braille inscription center is also functioning on the premises. The children have sports and physical development activities to instill confidence. They are taught cooking, cleaning, gardening and other life skills. Mathru gives vocational training as well, making candles, soaps, phenols, incense sticks, envelopes etc. Mathru markets the products made by the trainees and the profit is distributed among them. Children trained in the Academy have participated in street plays, drama and music programs in many places in Karnataka. Besides getting publicity for Mathru, these events serve to instill confidence in the children and encourage their talents. The press has acknowledged the work of the Mathru School by publishing articles about them. A DVD of one major public performance based on the Mahabaratha is also available.\r\n\r\nMathru works towards creating employment opportunities for the blind community. At present Mathru has given employment to two visually impaired teachers, one music teacher, one tabla master and a field worker. The Trust is sending one blind adult for further education towards a Diploma for Teaching the Blind. Another girl is being sent to the local Pre-University College. For the community at large, the Trust has organized many eye, medical, healthcare, dental and blood donation camps.\r\nThe school and all the associated activities run by Mathru are supported by local donations from businesses, charitable organizations and individual donors. Donations are made in cash and kind. Many dedicated volunteers who contribute their time and services also support Mathru.

Vilakudi is a bigger village with a population of about 4000. Around 2002, Mr. Arjun, Mrs. Radha Arjun, Mr and Mrs Shyamalan were running a project in this village to improve the education, economic conditions etc. in these villages.

The NIB project has developed the Universal Braille Kit (UBK), which consists of innovative tools such as the Vasantha Cube and the Natesan Block that help the blind child learn the alphabet and one of several suppported languages. Asha AZ has funded the manufacture of 1000 UBKs, which will be distributed to blind children through several organizations and blind schools across the country.\r\n\r\nProject II (Proposal submitted in September 05)\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\nAsha AZ is currently evaluating this proposal. The software solution from the IIT Chennai,  makes it possible for  anyone quickly learn to use computers, to create text in all Indian languages and produce them in local language or in braille versions on the screen for proof reading by the sighted. The text can then be transmitted as email attachments to Vidya Vrikshah or any other location where Braille Embossers are available and can be used to produce the text in embossed braille versions, which can then be sent free by post to whoever asks for it. \r\n\r\nThese facilities will be utlitized by Vidya Vrikshah to provide voice-enabled text books, magazines or news sheets, along with braille versions, for blind students in local languages (or also English). These possibilities have already been demonstrated by Vidya Vrikshah on its website. Importantly, anyone who does not have a computer or the above software, can avail of another related solution, viz. the proposed Online Braille Service. \r\n', 'Vidya Vrikshah', 'Vidya Vrikshah (VV) is an association of people drawn together, by devotion, to the free spread of knowledge, devoid of profit.

These are local (usually young) people who will be para-teachers in the village government primary school.  In each village, the selection is done by the panchayat and the village education committee.  The training will be carried out in 2000 locations across the state. This scale of training ? 80,000 teachers in 2000 locations simultaneously ? is perhaps unprecedented in India.

A ?practice? class has been included as an integral part of the training so that the PSM gets ?hands-on? experience of teaching during the training period itself.  The ?practice class? will use Pratham?s accelerated learning technique in reading and maths and follow an outcome-oriented and time-bound approach (with baseline assessment and ?tests? to track children?s progress.) \r\n\r\nWhy Is This So Important?\r\n\r\nBihar is struggling on almost every development parameter. The perception in rest of India and abroad is that, things are in bad shape.  There is widespread cynicism and skepticism about the possibility of change.  People in Bihar, especially those in economic duress, face many hardships.  But these hardships are compounded with the cruelest cut of them all ? lack of hope and belief that things can change.  \r\n\r\nFor any societal change ? the building blocks are hope and confidence. Hope that things will change and confidence that we as a group and I as an individual can participate in making that change happen. \r\n\r\nSo for Pratham, the larger picture is not simply about helping in the training 80,000 teachers or teaching 20,00,000 children to read, write and do basic math ? it is about building hope & confidence. Confidence that we can work in one of the most difficult states of India in such massive scale and we can help in make things work. and in being part of the solution. \r\n\r\nThis is what the opportunity is really about?.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecifically \r\n\r\nAcross India and especially in Bihar, large numbers of school going children have dismal levels of learning. Well over 50% children, in the age group 7 to 10 are not able to read, write and do basic math. Without these basic skills, it is impossible for them to continue or make further progress in the school system. There are many reasons for this : high student teacher ratios in government schools, lack of learning support at home as well as a lack of accountability of the school to parents or to the community. \r\n\r\nPanchayat Shiksha Mitra Training\r\n\r\nThe training schedule is the following:\r\n\r\nOct 2-14:  Orientation and training of master trainers. 2000 master trainers to be trained in 150 locations across the state (4 locations in each district.) (Bihar has 37 districts). Pratham will be able to orient these master trainers in the Pratham accelerated learning technique in reading and maths.  Master trainers will conduct a class during the course of their 10 day training. \r\n\r\nOct 15-19: Panchayat Shiksha Mitra Initial orientation of 5 days: During this period, Pratham will assist the master trainers in training PSMs in Pratham?s accelerated reading and maths techniques. 80,000 PSMs to be trained in 2000 locations across the state (4 locations in each block.) \r\n\r\nOct 25-Nov 16:  Each PSM will return to his village school and conduct a reading class with 25 children who are non-readers.  (During this period between Dushera and Diwali, PSM will get 16 working days). A pre-test and a ?mid? test will be done. \r\n\r\nNov 17:  The PSM will return to the training venue with his/her experiences and reports of the progress made by children during the ?practice? class. \r\n\r\nNov 19 to Dec 20:  PSM training module continues.\r\n\r\nSoon after the training PSM joins the school in which he or she will teach.  The government hopes to place all newly trained Panchayat Shiksha Mitras in the schools before the start of the new academic year in January 2005.\r\n\r\nPratham participation: \r\n\r\nThis is an unique opportunity for Pratham to help a state government not only build capacity to improve basic reading and arithmetic skills of children across the state but also assist them in creating an outcome oriented and time bound approach to ensuring learning for all children.  It is also a unique opportunity for Pratham teams across the country to participate in a joint effort.  We believe that during this 6 weeks, there will be substantial capacity development and learning for all Pratham people who participate. Pratham?s interaction with the PSMs will be not only during training sessions but also during field visits to support and encourage PSMs as they conduct their ?practice? class in their village. \r\n\r\n300 strong Pratham people from across the Pratham network are moving to Bihar from October 1 to just before Diwali (approx November 13-14 or so).  These are all people who have been good instructors themselves,. can communicate persuasively, and have voluntarily come forward to be to be part of the Bihar team effort. \r\n\r\nThere will be no additional payment to any full time Pratham person (in the case of balsakhis or teachers some stipend may be considered). Costs of travel, accommodation and food will be covered by Pratham. \r\n\r\nYou can help us in TWO WAYS :- \r\n\r\n1.	Come volunteer for one month in Bihar with us starting from October ?

But unfortunately, the state of affairs in basic primary school education leaves a lot to be desired. \r\n\r\nEstimates indicate that, of about 190-200 million children in the 6-14 age group in India, about 72 million children are out of school of which about 13 million have never been to school and about 59 million have been to school but have dropped out prior to class VIII. By Std X, 70% of all children enrolled would have dropped out of the school system. India also has one of the highest incidences of child labor in the world. \r\n\r\nPratham (www.pratham.org) works towards universalizing primary education in India. Pratham is one of the largest non-profits working in the primary education sector. It serves about 200,000 children across 10 states, with about 9000 young women volunteers through its direct programs and reaches out to over 3 million children through its indirect programs. Seeded by UNICEF and Mumbai Municipal Corporation in 1994, Pratham began in the slums of Mumbai. Currently, it serves economically underprivileged children across Maharasthra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.  \r\n\r\nOur mission is ?Every Child in School and Learning Well?. Pratham is a tripartite partnership ? between the corporates, government and citizens ? working closely with the government in the belief that the fastest and most efficient change can be brought about only by motivating the government at various levels. Rather than supplant, it supplements the governmental investment recognizing that primary education is principally the responsibility of the government. Pratham operates in scale and believes in demonstrating large scale solutions. All Pratham programs are designed to ensure that:\r\n?	enrollment in schools increases \r\n?	dropout from schools decrease \r\n?	influencing both the above, learning in schools and communities increase\r\n?	where impractical like child labor, to take education net to them \r\n?	the digital divide is dimished by promoting IT education and computer assisted learning\r\n?	there is replicability, sustainability and rapid scalability to serve large numbers\r\n\r\nPratham is also unique in that it is a citizens movement which has drawn people from all walks of life. The team consists of thousands of women volunteers from the communities ? who are the main engine ? as also social workers, activists, PhDs, MBAs, CAs, civil servants, bankers, corporate professionals, consultants, academics etc. \r\n\r\nWe have been supported by number of corporates like ICICI Bank, Reliance Industries, Citibank, HSBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Piramal Group, BILT, Mckinsey & Co., British Gas etc., and multilateral foundations like UNICEF, World Bank, Azim Premji Foundation, HPS Foundation, American India Foundation, Paul Hamlyn Foundation - UK, CIDA ?

Asha Chennai believes the revival and strengthening of the government schooling system is essential to the implementation of any mass education initiative in India.\r\n\r\nIn the last one year, the government schools all over Tamilnadu have started implementing the Activities Based Learning method of instruction for classes 1 to 4. While this seems to be having a positive effect on the education of the children, it brings with it some challenges as well, like the training of the teachers to use the materials, need for trays and bureaus to store these ABL materials etc. Asha has been helping meet these challenges as well.\r\n\r\nAsha Chennai has been working with eight government primary schools in the Thiruvallur district under Project Sangamam-Poondi. The Panchayat Union primary school which was supported under the <a href="http://www.ashanet.org/projects/project-view.php?p=831" target="_blank">Sangamam-Placepalayam</a> project has also been brought under Project Sangamam Poondi.\r\n\r\nIn the year 2004-05 Asha Chennai started the project with Panchayat Union Primary schools at Kuppammal Chathiram, Kanakavalli Puram and Pattarai Perambudur. In 2005-06 we also started supporting the school at Kunnavalam and the Balwadis at Kunnavalam and Kuppammal Chathiram. Further in 2006-07 we extended our support to the schools at Nemiliagaram and Pudhur and also the Balwadis at Nemiliagaram, and Pudhur. In 2007-08 we brought in the schools at Placepalayam (which has been supported since 2006-07 as a separate project) into this project and also added support for the school at SSA-Korattur.\r\n\r\nLocally the activities of the project has been coordinated by the project coordinator Srinivasan. We have further provided teachers (three each to Kunnavalam and Placepalayam, two each to Kuppammal Chathiram and Pattarai Perambudur and one each to Nemiliagaram, Pudhur, Kanakavalli Puram and SSA Korattur). We have also helped improve the infrastructure at the schools by repainting the boards, fixing the roof at Kuppammal Chathiram, building cooking areas for Kanakavalli Puram, Pudhur and Kuppammal Chathiram, provided electric fittings, plumbing facilities etc. We also sponsored the annual day functions at all these schools.\r\n\r\nIn doing all these activities we have been happy to find a supportive and energetic set of teachers at these schools. The district and panchayat officials have also been very supportive.\r\n\r\nThis year we hope to add support for one more school. The infrastructure at most of the schools are in a good shape. However some infrastructure work is required at Pudhur Balwadi and Nemiliagaram. The main thrust of the work this year continues to be with the actual education being provided at these schools.\r\n\r\n<Font color=maroon size=4> Schools/Balwadis to be covered:</font>\r\n\r\n<B><u>Kuppammal Chathiram School (from August 2004)</B></u>\r\nThe primary school in Kuppammal Chathiram has 110 students and 3 government teachers. The school has adequate building space to comfortably seat the children. The three government teachers working there were putting Rs. 100 each out of their own pocket to fund one Ms. Sumathy who has finished 12th standard to assist them with the children. We have taken Sumathy and Deivanayaki as Asha teachers at this school. Due to works done by Asha Chennai, all the buildings are also good shape. They also now have good toilets and a cooking room thanks to Asha. They would like a compound wall to protect the children from the nearby traffic.\r\n\r\n<B><u>Kanakavalli Puram School (from Dec 2004)</B></u>\r\nThis is a small school. It has only one multi-age class for all the children (in classes 1 to 5). There are 50 children. There was one building which was in a very bad shape. This has been replaced by a new building with the help of SSA. We have provided a closed area for cooking. Currently the school only has one head-mistress and one teacher. We have provided one Asha teacher. We have raised the level of the school ground. They would also like to have a front compound wall which will keep the school facilities from being used for tying stray cattle.\r\n\r\n<B><u>Pattarai Perambuthur School (from Dec 2004)</B></u>\r\nThis is the biggest school of the lot. This has 220 students and 5 teachers. The building space was inadequate when we started working with the school. Panchayat allocated space for an additional building and a new building has been constructed with SSA funds. Asha has provided two additional teachers. The school was first chosen as one of the model schools for Activities Based Learning. This has now been adopted for all the schools we are supporting. The school has improved a lot in recent years because of an additional government teacher and energetic teachers.\r\n\r\n<B><u>Kunnavalam School (from Oct 2005)</B></u>\r\nThis is a middle school and it has 130 students and 3 teachers. The buildings are in good shape and sufficient space is available for the classes. The number of teachers is very inadequate. Asha has provided three additional teachers. We hope to add a small library for this school since this is a middle school. The library books will be selected for the age group in the school. This will be managed by our teacher who will also manage the computer room.\r\n\r\n<B><u>Nemiliagaram School (from Dec 2006)</B></u>\r\nThis is a remote primary school and it has 80 students and 2 teachers. There is sufficient space in the two buildings. One of the building was in bad shape and has been repaired by Asha. Asha has provided one additional teacher. Another additional teacher would be helpful. The space around the school requires fencing in the back.  They would also like to have a front compound wall which will keep the school facilities from being used for illicit purposes in the evening.\r\n\r\n<B><u>Pudoor School (from Dec 2006)</B></u>\r\nThis is a primary school and it has 55 students and 2 teachers. Asha has provided one additional teacher. We have made some improvements to the cooking area as well as provided plumbing to the toilets. Now the infrastructure at the school is adequate.\r\n\r\n<B><u>Placepalayam School (from Dec 2006)</B></u>\r\nThe Panchayat Union Middle at Placepalayam has been in existence since 1948. Today it has 190 students in Classes 1 to 8 and 5 government teachers. Asha has provided 3 teachers for the school. The land for the for a new building, was donated by the father of a teacher supported by Asha (now working at the school). A new building was build with a grant from SSA and toilets were also repaired. However couple of the old buildings are also not in good shape. One of them require some minor roof repair which we hope to undertake this year. Partitions are also required between classes at this school. Since this is also a middle school here also we hope to add a computer as well as a small library. The computer part is not covered here in the budget. We hope to get one donated.\r\n\r\n<B><u>SSA-Korattur School (from Dec 2006)</B></u>\r\nThis is a primary school and it has 95 students and 2 government teachers. Asha has provided one additional teacher. We hope to provide one more teacher. Partitions will be required for the classrooms. Black boards will be required and some basic materials provided to the other schools will also be required here.\r\n\r\n<B><u>Balwadis at Kuppammal Chathiram, Kunnavalam, Pudoor and Nemiliagaram (from Dec 2006)</B></u>\r\nThese Balwadi are the feeder Balwadis for the respective schools. There are 25 students at each Balwadi with one teacher and two Ayahs. We provided some mats and play materials in 2006-07. We provided some sports materials, painted the Black boards and provided plates and tumblers to all the Balwadis. We need to provide some more materials to these Balwadis. All of them require electric connection/fittings and some sprucing up of the insides. Pudoor Balwadi also require repairs to the roof and building, and also required repairs to the kitchen.\r\n\r\n<Font color=maroon size=4>Other General Inputs From Asha:</font>\r\n\r\nAsha Chennai has undertaken several projects with government schools. As part of these projects Asha Chennai provides several standard inputs including,\r\n\r\n   1. One set of Uniforms for the students. The one set that the government gives is grossly inadequate for wearing every day for a year.\r\n   2. Notebooks/Slate for the children.\r\n   3. Other education material as appropriate for the class. This would range from crayons to atlases and geometry boxes.\r\n   4. Bring the teachers from these projects to Chennai for training. This would be covered under the budget for Project Rightstart.\r\n   5. Trips by educationists from Chennai to these projects to monitor, provide onsite training and other inputs for the teachers in these schools.\r\n\r\nFurther this project being in a remote area would require a local coordinator and cannot be executed directly by the volunteers in Chennai.

While water is an essential to flush out / drain the saline, water is a scare commodity is a scarce commodity is also a reality. Now they are getting the last flow from Mettur dam release. As these villages are on the tail end of cauvery delta, the possibilities are very feeble. Further, good rains to the extent expected by these farmers cannot be expected in near future. The only alternative suggested and agreed by most of the farming group is that after 15 days to a month, when these lands are further dried up, plough them in a dry situation. By doing this ploughing, the soil will be exposed for better airing and that will help to drain in it better whenever it rains or water flow is sufficient in cauvery canals.\r\n\r\nFrom the assessment, the land to be ploughed while it is dry itself in the three agricultural villages is coming to about 625 hectares (1562 acres) in Manickapangu, Veppanchery and Kumarakudi villages.

There is also a need to see how organise the farmers on common issues, bring in collectivism, how to reach out only to affected land owners, not to use tractors but to insist ploughing with bullocks so that these farmers get the benefit of our programme, involving agricultural landless labourers also in the process so that we avoid their migration in the forthcoming summer etc. \r\n', 'Rejuvenate India Movement', 'Rejuvenate India Movement (RIM) is a network of committed NGOs and individuals working together to promote and strengthen self reliant communities by catalyzing mass movement through people?s participation in India.

The Government of Tamilnadu has ordered every school in the rural and urban areas to remove thatched roofs and lite-roofing for safety reasons. The roofs have to be replaced by asbestos or concrete structures. The schools may face closure if they do not abide by this order. This is enormously costly for the villagers to afford.  Unlike schools in the towns and cities, the village schools are run for the poor with acute shortage of funds. Funds for these works at government schools are provided by the government itself. Many Government aided schools under private management are in desperate need for funds for these works. \r\n\r\nThe management of these schools, comprising of a few villagers, are desperately looking for financial assistance from different sources.

It lies in a backward area of this district that is not river irrigated and is thus dependent on the mercies of rain for their single crop. There are other rural development projects in this village by Vijay Sappani, a volunteer from Asha Canada. He had requested Asha Chennai to make a site visit to the village school. The intention was to undertake improvements to the quality of education at this school in the lines of the other schools we are working with in Project Sangamam. Vijay Sappani is looking at a bigger project that will look at all aspects of quality of life at this village and cause improvement to all of them. The aspects of this project include health, nutrition, income generation, micro-credit, advocacy of their rights etc. Project Sangamam-Jambumadai will be a part of this broader project to uplift the village.\r\n\r\nThe village sends its children for 6th to 12th standard to schools in Thathangar pettai and Thuraiyoor. One of the main complaints of the villagers is the lack of regular bus service to take these children to the school. More than any quality improvement at their primary school, this was their main complaint. Many children especially girls drop out after 5th standard because of this problem. We should try and address this by raising the issue with the appropriate officials. Vijay Sappani has already contacted the district Collector''s office.The district Collector has agreed to take the issue with the Transportation department and have it fixed before the end of December 2005.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the education at the school is similar to other rural government schools in Tamilnadu. The school did not have much in terms of materials. The remoteness of the place means there isn''t really any alternative available to these students in terms of private education. Some of the richer people in the village send their children to English medium schools in neighbouring towns.

The village has 131 families [population 466; 70 children, 15 babies of less than 2 years old]. Two social workers Sandhya Sundar and Anoushka Ravishankar have been working with this village since the Tsunami. Asha Chennai is supporting the rehabilitation efforts at these villages by them.\r\n\r\nThe beachfront at Nemmelikuppam is a white stretch of sand, very picturesque, the sea stretching away on both sides, and no other habitation to be seen other than the now broken houses, devastated by the tsunami waves that hit the coast. The once clean sand now houses clumps of boat, net, thatch and household debris. The people of Nemmelikuppam say they have lost their homes, streets, clothes...the tools of our profession.\r\n\r\n \r\nThe village had a few thatched houses and more made of brick and stone. The thatched houses have been completely blown away. A road that had been constructed recently along the sea just wasn''t there. Brick walls have broken down or fallen. Glass from windows, wooden doors and household debris litter the place. There was a small strip of tarmac and jelly stones [these are small stones that are used with cement to create the base of a road and hot tar is poured over this to form the road] had been blown away, some lying along the ECR. \r\n\r\nCatamarans that had been beached along the water line lie damaged and upturned inland, some on top of houses. Of the 29 boats [fiberglass as well as catamarans] they had, 13 remain. The rest were taken by the sea. The water mark on the houses lie about three-quarters of the way up the walls. Electric poles were down; people from the department were putting in new electric lines. Houses have tilted, walls are broken. In some houses, the foundations have been exposed. The water and sand and seaweed has got into everything: groceries, clothes, books. The houses still had about four inches of water. All the fishing nets have been washed away or damaged beyond use. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe village is on a slight incline and the sea, they said, came in from three sides. The men had just returned with the day?s catch and had not noticed anything out at sea. When they saw the first high wave come towards the shore, the villagers abandoned their homes and ran to safety on higher ground, across the ECR and on to the opposite side. They say there were five waves in succession, each higher that the previous one. The highest was thirty-feet. By then everyone had reached safe ground, and no lives were lost. The people of the village are housed temporarily in makeshift camps near the ECR. \r\n\r\n \r\nA couple of young educated boys from Nemelikuppam had prepared a list of residents in each household, the number of children in school, their names and the classes in which they were studying. \r\n\r\n\r\n<B>Rehabilitation Work Undertaken</B>\r\n \r\n1.

ICDS runs several Balwadis (pre-primary education centres) across the country targeting children 2-5 years of age. During these pre-primary years is when children make great strides in development, especially in the following areas:\r\n\r\n* Cognitive Development â€“ Thinking and reasoning abilities that help children learn letters, colours, counting, and develop their imagination.\r\n* Language Development â€“ They begin to learn more number of words between 50 words at age 2 to thousands of words at age 5.\r\n* Sensory and Motor Development â€“ Kids at age 2 learn to walk up and down stairs, make small strokes with a pencil, kick a ball, while kids at age 5 can make simple drawings and write some letters.\r\n\r\nIn 2003-04, volunteers of Asha Chennai undertook a study of several Balwadis in Chennai and made quite a few observations. These Balwadis were typically places where children ate and remained inactive. There were no materials for children to explore and learn, and not much to stimulate the child. Not much teacher guidance was available because the Balwadi teachers were constantly doing a lot of administrative work. The teachers seemed to be wasting valuable time just getting children to be quiet while she should have been facilitating childrenâ€™s activities.\r\n\r\nAlso, these Balwadis lacked basic facilities like electricity and water. There were no toilets. For cooking, they typically used wood for fuel with a bad chimney causing smoke to enter the buildings. There were often other infrastructural problems like leaking roof. Further they lacked playing materials, plates/tumblers for eating, mats for lying down, etc. Environment and hygienic conditions left much to be desired.\r\n\r\nIn such a set-up, a lack of direction and instruction hampers the development of childrenâ€™s important skills during pre-primary years. Based on the study, Asha decided to help with some of these Balwadis in the hope of bringing about positive changes. The government departments in charge of this scheme were happy about this study and allowed Asha to go ahead with this project. A letter allowing the improvements was obtained from this Department of Social Welfare. The people at the ground level (the teachers and helpers at the Balwadi as well as the people of these communities) welcomed our involvement. \r\n\r\nOver the past few years, we have been closely involved with six Balwadis through this project:\r\n\r\n* Oorur Kuppam (Nos. 1078 & 1082) â€“ two centres in one building (twin)\r\n* Ekambaram Pillai St. (1054)\r\n* Ekambaram Pillai St. (1057)\r\n* Nochi Nagar (1063 & 1064) â€“ twin centres\r\n* Nochi Kuppam (1065)\r\n* Nochi Kuppam (1066)\r\n\r\nAsha has made several improvements in these Balwadis over the years.\r\n\r\n* Employed additional teachers to actively engage children and promote consistent learning focused primarily on cognitive, language and sensory development.\r\n* Trained teachers regularly through workshops.\r\n* Provided toys and educational materials, as well as stationery items such as picture charts, chart paper, sketch pens, glue, pencils and erasers to all Balwadis.\r\n* In terms of building repairs, significant contributions have been made toward fixing leaking roofs, ground repairs, and kitchens. \r\n* Items for improving and maintaining cleanliness such as cleaning liquids, toilette soaps, towels and brushes have been provided.\r\n* Kitchen items like vessels, pots, water jugs and drums were also supplied.\r\n\r\nAsha volunteers have also solved a few vandalism issues and civic problems with the co-operation of the police and municipality.

This inspiration lead to the Sri Aurobindo Society, based in Pondicherry, persuading the Government of India in 1966 to accept and support the project, which was then put before UNESCO for its endorsement. Aurobindo called for spiritual regeneration of India as the path for rebirth of India. He started as a spiritual leader in Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry.

She founded the city of Auroville based on this philosophy. The city is within a 3 km radius - a multinational, multilingual and multicultural population living within its limits.

In 1999 FIRM organised a conference in Thiruvananthapuram, to discuss the problems of sex workers, with participation of people from various walks of life, and hundreds of sex workers from all over Kerala. It turned out that one of the major concerns of the sex workers was regarding their children. Subsequently, FIRM conducted a need-assessment study, through which 187 children were identified in Thiruvananthapuram, and 37 of them short-listed as the most needy. About half of the short-listed children had some sort of housing, while housing had to be arranged for the others. Initial attempts were to place them in orphanages, which met with serious difficulties. It is at this point that Anil and Roja decided to have the children stay at their house. This home later became Chilla. \r\n\r\nCurrently Chilla houses about 15 children, and in addition provides emergency support to many more children of sex workers in the city.

The women find themselves as widows by the time they come to know that their spouse is HIV positive.HUT in the process of addressing the medical and psychological needs of the HIV positive people found that the greatest concern of these people was about the future of their children.\r\n\r\nHUT realized that all the years of development work put in by voluntary organizations and government agencies were fast wheeling back as the consequence of the disease. And with careful analysis of the lives of the clients suggested that the worst affected was the future generation, which due to lack of proper educational facilities and parental guidance where exposed to the risk of resorting to illegal activities and girl facing the risk of being dragged into sex trafficking. This increases the danger of scaling up the HIV/AIDS infection scenario.\r\nSensing the urgency of the problem and realizing that very little is being done in this regard, HUT decided to intervene in the consequences of the disease. With the vast experience gained from the education project of 20 years in the rural area of Mannachanallur HUT decided that imparting the children from Families affected by AIDS (FAAs) was the best way to address this problem.\r\n\r\nExpected Outcome:\r\n.

The parents of most students are agricultural workers or daily labourers.', 'Uttaranchal is one of the newest states of the Indian Union, and one of the poorest too.  The district of Champawat is located in the south-eastern part of the state, along the border with Nepal.  In the rural hilly areas, the schools are not always equipped to handle the number of students in terms of teachers and infrastructure.  There is the problem of student retention, as the parents sometimes cut short their children''s education and involve them in the house or work.  As the students go towards higher classes, they are not equipped with the skill sets which can enable them to lead a decent life - ie. vocational skills are not imparted to the students.  This is an important requirement, as the economic oppurtunities in the region are not plentiful.\r\n\r\nThe Savidya Upasamiti, with Asha''s help, shall work with the schools - primary, middle and high - in the district and improve the teaching facilities to encourage students to complete their education, and enable them with the necessary skills to lead a decent and dignified life.  \r\n\r\nIn 2005-06, the project "adopted" a primary school in the Kulethi village, and augmented the school resources by building a new classroom, a library and a playground, and adding three new teachers, distributing school uniforms and study kits to all children and by organizing bi-annual health camps. The Kulethi school also became the first primary school in the hilly regions to introduce computer education. The efforts resulted in: (a) an increase in enrollment (from 52 to 98), (b) appointment of a teacher for every class, (c) reduced drop-out rates and increaseed student attendance.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by the project''s success, Asha and Savidya decided to expand the project. In 2006-07, two more schools were included - a middle school in Dungra Sethi and a primary school in Haldwani, thereby benefiting 338 children. As in the first year, additional teachers were appointed to all the schools. Health camps were organized, and school uniforms and study kits were distributed to the students.  Savidya organized numerous interactions between students, parents/guardians and teachers, and also organized "learning trips" for the students to local government and private institutions.  Savidya''s efforts have received wide publicity, and a steady stream of local and state leaders have visited the school to learn how a model educational system can be established.\r\n\r\nFollowing two years of learning and success, Asha and Savidya have embarked on a multi-pronged initiative to create a comprehensive educational framework.  In 2007-08, the project proposes to:\r\n(a) Expand the Support-A-School program to include 6 schools (4 primary and 2 middle schools)\r\n(b) Establish a Learning Resource Center to enable learning in a group setting and in an interactive manner\r\n(c) Organize teacher training workshops to train teachers from schools that are not covered by the project\r\n(d) Organize meetings and lectures to increase awareness among the parents and the community regarding education and other rights \r\n(e) Establish a Vocational Educational Program\r\n\r\nNearly 680 children are expected to be covered under the project.

Even though her heart problems was solved, she continued to be troubled by constant attacks of fits. When she was eleven years old after one such severe attack, she went into a coma from which she never recovered. Shilpa left this world on December 1st 1995 .It was a great loss for her parents as their life centered on her and it was difficult to fill the vacuum created by her loss.

These years also play a very crucial role in how children learn to use their senses to investigate, explore and organize information in their minds and learn how to talk cogently- narrate and describe.   \r\n\r\nThe Balwadi programme in India is an outcome of the recognition of the need to expose children from the economically less privileged sections of society and give them a good start in life. \r\n\r\nThere is a Balwadi in almost every village in Tamilnadu and also quite a number of them in the cities. The Balwadis in Tamilnadu also have a noon meal scheme. There is also ''sattu mavu'' provided for nutritious ''laddu'' snack for the 2-4 year olds.. \r\n\r\nHowever these Balwadis now have become places where children eat and keep quiet. There is no material for children to explore and learn. There is not much to stimulate the child. Not much teacher guidance is available because the Balwadi teacher is constantly filling out information and delivering it to the nearest government Department office. Children learn to be passive or complain about others. The teacher is wastes valuable time just getting children to be quiet while she should be facilitating children?s activity.  There are no toilets. \r\n\r\nThe Elliots Beach Balwadi has all the above problems besides also the number of children. There are about 80 children ages 2 to 5 and only one teacher to look after them. The teacher cannot do much except get the children to sit quietly or have children repeat after her. The monotony of this tells on both the children and the teacher. \r\n\r\nA cook prepares the meal and the snack.

When there is no farming possible the farmers are forced to work for wages by migrating to nearby mines and factories.

Our aim is that Siragu Montessori School , will be a feather in the wings for its children to fly.\r\n\r\nWe believe that children belong in schools and not in streets. So we, at Suyam, started Siragu Montessori in June 2003, specifically for children of street dwellers and other economically challenged groups in the society.\r\n\r\nLocated at Palavedu Pettai, in Palavedu Panchayat, near Avadi, Chennai, the school provides enjoyable and relevant quality education to first-generation learners in Palavedu Panchayat and to street children from in and around Chennai.\r\n\r\nWe follow the Montessori style of education to help build creativity in the children and realize their potentials. The child''s overall/holistic development in an eco friendly environment is our emphasis.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the school was in the Nadaipathai Pookkal Program. The Nadaipathai Pookkal community in Shastri Nagar, in Palavedu Panchayat, were initially suspicious of our efforts and intentions. But after much interaction, the community itself started pressuring and encouraging us to start the school. They saw that meeting their educational needs provided them with an avenue to better their lives.\r\n\r\nSiragu also provides education to families in Palavedu Panchayat who have been, for generations, scavenging, farming, pig farming, manufacturing or working in brick kilns, and are economically deprived. All the children at Siragu are first generation learners. For the children from brick kilns we provide a bridge course for the 6 months that these children spend with their parents in the kilns. At this time the children are away from their schools.\r\n\r\nAs a local community based school, Siragu facilitates easy access to the school for local children. Siragu provides a child friendly, flexible and customized, curriculum that includes vocational education as well. Our teachers are from the community. And we also provide empowerment programs to the community.\r\n\r\nSiragu also runs a hostel, where we house our 14 adopted children. We adopt children who face parental pressure to beg, to absent themselves from school, and live in dysfunctional homes where parents focus on day to day survival without giving much importance to the children''s development. We also adopt street children in Chennai.\r\n\r\nOur staff at present includes a Principal, a Vice Principal, a Coordinator, 6 Teachers and 3 Non-teaching staff. Additionally, a Montessori trainer comes on a monthly basis to work with the teaching staff. The teacher student ratio is 1:13. Our curriculum is bilingual, in Tamil and English, and includes educative interactive fun activities such as miming, theatre etc.\r\nToday, within a year, the school is recognized by the community. Starting with 25 children, now 82 children study in Siragu. The school is also recognized outside the community. On July 30 2003, Mr. P.S. Ramamohan Rao, Governor of Tamil Nadu, visited the school.The initial efforts of the team were met with antagonism and suspicion but sustained efforts caused a few parents to allow their children to attend school.\r\n\r\nThe success of these students at school helped other parents also to gather courage to send their children. Eventually the rush from this community as well as others became so much that it was felt the right time to start a school.\r\n\r\nA school was begun in locally rented premises. The condition of the building was quite poor (eighty years old, poor upkeep, no roof, vermin infested) but volunteer assistance garnered by Suyam helped them make it habitable.\r\n\r\nAt present in out own land constructed 10 temporary class rooms and 200 children were studying in SIRAGU (out of which more than 50 children are from Brick Chambers).

This village is located in Jatani block and is 20 km away from Bhubaneswar.  \r\n\r\nThis project targets the children (boys and girls) of daily laborers. Because of their financial situation and the illiteracy among their parents, these children are often forced to join the workforce. So they either drop out of the local Government school or do not enroll in school at all. \r\n\r\nâ€˜Education for allâ€™ has 2 distinct activities. It has a pre-school to motivate kids and their parents to send the kids to Govt. school.  The age of children who attend pre-school ranges from 2.5 to 5 years. This project provides the children preliminary education, food and medicine. \r\n\r\nThe 2nd part of this project is a supplementary education program. Once the kids are enrolled in Govt. school it provides them support (tuition, vocational training, food, medicines, and textbooks) to make sure that they don''t drop out.  This program also provides education to the children who have already dropped out from school and tries to put them back in the Govt. school.\r\n\r\nThe total number of children enrolled for year 2006-07 is 62. 32 of them attend the pre-school. The pre-school runs from 9:30 am to 1:00 pm. The children are given lunch after the study hour which is also the incentive for them to come to the school. The supplementary education program consists of 30 children. These classes for children are conducted from 4:30pm to 8:30pm.  In this program teachers help the students to understand the study material that they had been taught during school hours.  This supplementary school ends with dinner around 10:00pm in the night. There are 4 teachers who take care of both the pre-school and supplementary school programs.\r\n\r\nThis project is being funded by Asha-Colorado and Asha-Cleveland. Asha-Colorado is supporting the educational costs for this project i.e. teachers'' salary and the cost of educational material (text books, note books, geometry equipments, pen/pencil etc.). Asha-Cleveland is funding the nutritional budget of this project. \r\n\r\nIn the first round of funding Asha-Colorado has disbursed $1100 to â€˜Education for allâ€™.

The next targets of the organization were educated unemployed youth in that area. Vocational training in house wiring, dress making etc. was conducted using grants from state/central Govt. The above programs were not completely non-profit activities as the organization got some percentage of profit by selling the manufactured candles in the local market.\r\n\r\nOnce Padmashree Society had enough money to start non-profit activities, a day-care center was started for the old people in the local area. This was followed by a pre-school and supplementary education program for the local children. These programs are experimenting with various innovative techniques of teaching to attract and retain children. Last year, the school had 28 children. Due to the positive result of the school the number of children has gone up to 62 this year.

Spastics Society of Karnataka is one of the pioneering organizations working with person with disabilities of different Socio-economic strata for the last twenty five years. This organization was started in the year 1981 (as Spastics Society of India from 1982 to 1994 and Spastics Society of Karnataka from 1994 onwards), under the societies registration act of 1960 with a team of socially sensitive people..  With this experience the organisation understood the need for quality diagnostic methods for betterment of the Educational and Rehabilitation services.  Hence, the Diagnostic and Research Center with Multi-Medical, Educational and Rehabilitation services using the state of art equipment was started, helping us to improve on overall services.\r\n\r\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE ORGANISATION\r\n\r\nTo collect, organize and disseminate knowledge related to prevention, treatment, education and rehabilitation of developmentally disabled from various national and International sources.\r\nTo represent the society at both the National and International conferences or committee for the furtherance of the aims and objectives similar to those of the society.\r\nTo undertake studies and research in the field of rehabilitation of disabled and publish the results in the national and international level.\r\nTo conduct medical rehabilitation and special educational approaches to develop the disabled person to his/her maximum potential and then train them into some income generation activity.\r\nTo reach quality educational, vocational, for the poor children in urban and rural areas by transporting them to main center where there is a diagnostic and research unit with quality rehabilitation team and state of art equipment.\r\nIt is opined that provision of education to persons with disabilities with an inclusive orientation is the â€˜most effective means of combating discriminatory attitudes, creating welcoming communities, building an inclusive society and achieving education for allâ€¦â€™ (Salamanca Statement And Framework For Action On Special Needs Education, 1994).\r\nIn India, The National Policy on Education (NPE) (1986) and other declarations subsequent to the policy (Delhi Declaration On Education For All, 1993) recommended as a goal to integrate the differently abled with general communities at all levels and ensure a place for all children in school, in consonance with their capabilities.\r\nThough a number of baseline studies have been conducted in the District Primary Education Programme (DPEP) districts, the achievement levels of disabled children have not been commented on. The Project Integrated Education of the Disabled children (PIED) launched in 1988-89 did touch this issue. Findings indicate that the achievement/learning levels of disabled children in general are at par with those of non-disabled children. \r\nLearning is the process of acquiring, and retaining knowledge so it may be applied in life situations. Learning is not a passive process. Millions of children have been labeled learning disabled. Learning can become a nightmare when there are memory problems, difficulties in following directions, trouble with the visual or auditory perception of information, and an ability to perform paper-and-pencil tasks (i.e. writing compositions, note taking, doing written homework, and taking tests).

For generations, these communities have never had any real opportunity to break out of their situation, make education a priority or pursue a sustainable source of livelihood. Siragu was therefore started in 2003 with the aim to reach out to the most underprivileged, equip them with competent education and  open doors for these children who would otherwise have been lost to begging on the streets, child labour, child marriage, homelessness and another generation of missed opportunities.\r\n\r\nSince most of the children at the school have no other place to go to, the classrooms at Siragu double up as a safe and sanitary place of residence for more than 150 of them. The school currently educated over 400 children and has 35 teaching staff and 17 non-teaching staff.\r\n\r\nEducation at Siragu\r\nSiragu currently educates over 400 children from KG-1 to Std 8. Children passing out of class 8 are provided with training specifically catered to appear for various entrance exams conducted at state, national and international levels. Since the school currently does not have the facilities to provided quality education for Stds 11 and 12, a special provision has been arranged for in the neighboring private schools to admit children completing the common entrance exams at Std 10 level from Siragu. This way the complete schooling is ensured for every child at Siragu. \r\n\r\nSiragu has adopted the Montessori method of teaching, four-corner method of listening, reading, writing and creativity. This method coupled with efficient usage of learning materials by the teachers at Siragu has helped made going to school for these kids, not just beneficial but also fun. In addition to academic curriculum, ample importance is also given to sports, martial arts, yoga, music, dance and creative and practical learning. The children are encouraged to take part in a variety of extra-curricular and co-curricular competitions to hone their skills. These techniques along with daily school-van pick up services and 3 nutritious meals provided by Siragu has helped massively in bringing down drop-out rates, preventing kids from reverting to begging and encouraging neighboring communities to make educating their children a priority. \r\n\r\nSiragu has an open admission policy and children are taken in all year-round, further encouraging them to join school. Perhaps the most commendable aspect of the team at Siragu is that despite severe short-falls in funding sources and faculty, in no way do they compromise on providing wholesome and quality education to the kids in the school.\r\n\r\n* Main Challenges\r\n  1. Infrastructure (stable buildings and classrooms,      uniforms, monthly stationary and education material) to support growing no. of students in school \r\n\r\n  2. Constant, recurring and reliable sources of funding to support operating costs such as teacher and staff salaries, van expenses, construction needs, education material etc. \r\n\r\n  3. Source of administration support for financial advice, school building construction, quality English and Computer education \r\n\r\n  4. Drop-out rates of students, reverting to begging etc.- which have however almost completely put an end to \r\n\r\n  5. Convincing parents to make education of their kids a priority \r\n\r\n  6. With respect to construction of buildings, constant source of funding for the duration of construction in order to complete it as per plan without compromises due to inflation in cost price.\r\n\r\nSuccess Stories\r\nSiragu was started for kids primarily belonging to communities where begging was the only source of livelihood. Making the kids join as well as regularly attend school was therefore a major challenge. Today, all of the 125 students who stay at the Siragu home have completely quit begging and have grown into talented, all-rounded individuals equipped for a great future. The stories of some of Siragu''s many bright young minds are as follows: \r\n\r\nC.Jayavel: Jayavel has become a role model to the begging community he once belonged to. He is one of the brightest students we have seen in Siragu so far. After studying in Siragu until class X, he appeared for the IGSCE exam conducted by Cambridge University this year, and we are extremely hopeful of Jayavel procuring high grades. He has also appeared for various international Olympiad exams and NIOS exams and fared well. He has completed 4 levels in Hindi proficiency exams conducted by Hindi Prachara Sabha. He is also well noted and awarded for his excellent communication skills. In appreciation of his past record, Vellammal Higher Secondary School, one of the most reputed schools in Chennai has admitted him for completing his high school education with full scholarship. The young achiever wants to become a computer engineer and help children from his community to get educated. \r\n\r\nNitheeshkumar: Niteeshkumar was one of the first students at Siragu. During the last eight years of his education at Siragu, he has not only honed is skills in academics and creative studies, but has also grown up to be an extremely responsible young adult. He has consistently scored above 85% in all exams at Siragu. One of his many assets are his is command over languages. He has been the recipient of many awards of Excellence in Elocution in English, conducted by Bhoomi Trust, Chennai and other essay-writing contests. He is also very proficient in Hindi, and like Jayavel, has completed 4 levels in Hindi Proficiency Exams. A highlight in his achievements is his selection in the Words-Worth International Spelling Bee Competition at the International level, after winning at various qualifying rounds at the national level. He is also preparing to participate in the American National Spelling Bee. Niteesh is currently preparing for IGCSE exam conducted by Cambridge University and intends to pursue a PhD. When he grows up, he wants to be a Professor and further the cause of Siragu for the betterment of the society. \r\n\r\nE. Murugan: Murugan is also one of the first students to join Siragu. He comes from a greatly impoverished family that has been begging for generations. Murugan is also a bright student that has made Siragu proud with his growth. He was among the top 500 contestants at the International Science Olympiad with a score of 89.35%. He also participated in the Words Worth international spelling bee competition and completed proficiency tests by Hindi Prachara Sabha. Murugan wants to become a doctor when he grows up, while at the same time educating poor kids in need. Murugan''s mother, Chinnamma, was able to send three of her seven children to school till she met with an accident, broke her hip bone and got caught in heavy "meter interest loan" to repay her medical bills. The children were forced to start selling small commodities at traffic signals to repay the debt. With the help of an individual donor, Siragu was able to pay her principal, so she could let her kids attend school instead. With her recovery, Chinnamma is slowly able to pay back Siragu without an interest being charged. \r\n\r\n', 'Suyam Charitable Trust', 'Suyam Charitable Trust was formally registered under Trust Act in August 1999 by a group of young college students and social workers, who were deeply involved with various social service activities since 1987.\r\n\r\nSuyam Charitable Trust works to:\r\n\r\n*  To network with likeminded groups and institutions to multiply development impact.\r\n\r\n*  To Promote awareness among public.\r\n\r\n*  To Conduct special programs for downtrodden people.\r\n\r\n*  To bring out, encourage and develop the hidden skills of pupils, teachers.\r\n\r\n*  To help the old, disabled, destitute, handicapped and poor people who are the inmates of various homes in Tamil Nadu.\r\n\r\n*  To work for eradicating Aids by organizing and conducting Aids Awareness Camps.\r\n\r\n*  To organize Camp, Training Programs in order to develop Creativity,\r\n    Personality and Scientific outlook among students & etc.\r\n\r\n*  Support youth in education and career guidance.\r\n\r\n*  Develop in the youth a social consciousness.\r\n\r\n*  Ameliorate the suffering of individuals in distress.\r\n\r\n*  Work with communities in poverty and improve their lives.', 'Siragu believes that no child must be denied quality education, however poor, however ill-exposed.

Since from the beginning stage of the programme various types of programmes and strategies were designed and the programmes were implemented in the villages.  Due to the multipronged strategies and the collective effort of the staff team and the community, the programme has yielded many positive results.\r\nObjectives: \r\n\r\n1. To educate the people  to understand the reality of child labour.\r\n\r\n2. To remove the children from workforce and readmit into regular school.\r\n\r\n3. To organise alternative education centres for working chlidren.\r\n\r\n4. To motivate the rural parents to encourage children''s education.\r\n\r\n5.

Orienting the regular primary school teachers and headmasters to involve in the child labour eradication activities.\r\n\r\n4.

The first one \r\nis the loan they take from outside money lenders.  The other one is harassment of women by the money lenders as well as the commission agents\r\nThe Block receives very small amount of rainfall every year.  Due to the frequent failure of monsoon people in the area have become discouraged with cultivation.  Apart from Agriculture Beedi Rolling is the main occupation of most of the women in the area.\r\n\r\nMore than 9 beedi establishments are running their business in this Block.  It has been estimated that more than 20,000 women are now engaged in beedi rolling through out the Block.  A sizeable population of girl children (68%) are also engaged in the occupation child labour is prevalent almost in all the villages of Pappakudy block.  As per the survey conducted in 2003, it is found that 336 male and 551 female children are engaged in works.  Apart from beedi, there are also children who are engaged in agriculture, bricks and shops.\r\nDue to the heavy interest collected by the money lenders the poor families in some villages are driven out of their houses since they could not pay the amount as heavy interest.  So, it is easy for the money lenders to make the women fall in to their trap easily.The women here are also treated as second class situation like any other society.  But the incidents of sexual harassment is more in many of the villages.  Mostly, the money lenders exploit the poverty of the women and use them for their sexual need.  Also the beedi rolling women have to adjust  with the beedi commission agents and contractors.  Otherwise, they may have to lose that wage and other benefits.  Thus, the problems of beedi workers are still on the increase. Since beedi rolling is the only major profession is available, it is taken by the local community, even though it fetches less than the survival income.  This is the main reason for the women to encourage their children also to do beedi rolling.  This has resulted in low literacy rate of women when composed to other area of industries.', 'NAVA JEEVAN TRUST TIRUNELVELI - 627 005 TAMILNADU', 'ORGANIZATION PARTICULARS\r\n\r\nNAME OF THE PROJECT HOLDER: B.

This will help them sustain their livelihood by indulging in productive trades. Some may be enrolled in colleges.\r\n7) Cultural therapy like teaching painting, games like football, karate etc. are conducted to enhance the confidence of children, and especially girl children.\r\n8) Outings/picnics carried out for children. These could sometimes be something as simple as a train ride, because many of the children in rural districts have never ridden on a train. Other outings include trips to historical sites etc. \r\n\r\n\r\nSite visit report\r\n\r\nI saw about 60 or so students (not sure about the number) of several age groups studying. The older students were doing there homework, whereas the younger students (pre-school or just entered school) were being given some basic education. Many of the students came and spoke to me, and children of the age 3 or 4 came and greeted me and conversed with me in English, which I found very impressive. Some students had just been admitted to a formal school, and they introduced themselves. I met a student, who due to domestic reasons had dropped out of school, but Jabala convinced her family to allow her to go back to school again. \r\n\r\nOnce the class was over I spoke to parents of some of these children. Incidentally all of the parents were mothers, and all of them wanted their children to study and go ahead in life, but were faced with opposition from family. Jabala has been a great facilitator in ensuring that these children keep coming to school. \r\n\r\nI was also shown beautiful paintings done by one of the girls. The most touching moment was however, when I was leaving and a child who would probably be 3 or 4 yrs old came up to me and said goodbye, and then pointed to a house and in clear English said â€œThis is my houseâ€. \r\n\r\n', 'Jabala Action Research Organization', 'The philosophy of the organisation rests on the premise that children should cherish every moment of their association with the activities of the centre The existing system of education that believes in â€˜One size fits all â€˜ , often deters children to be attracted to the curriculum. Since education has limited scope of being innovative  the organisation always filled the gap by inventing  new methods that will help children learn better. The organisation always tried to instil some values and confidence in the children , which they are not usually expected to have. Constant effort had been to understand the psychological bent of mind through use of colour, music and other finer activities. In the initial years the children were presented with plants and they were asked to personify the plants and interact with them, take care of them. This was done to inculcate the sense of belonging, which the children  lacked.\r\nThe bonding between the family and the children by asking their mothers to aware of the of the activities the children were indulging in. Moreover  attempts were made to develop a stronger bonding between the mother and child . The  child was asked to take photo graphs of their mothers. The organisation still believes in overall development of a child more so on the mental development so that a child behave normally and find love and happiness and feel  life is worth living.\r\nToday, of course, work has expanded both in terms of geographical areas of operation and in the range of programmes.\r\n\r\nJABALA seeks to empower children in difficult situation to meet with confidence and imagination the challenges of life.

A team of 18 grass root activists associated with Harshaâ€™s India 700k exercise has been nominated for National Virtual Academy fellowship by M.S.Swaminathan Foundation. Two of them have received the fellowship already. The remaining team of at least 50 more volunteer leaders is aspiring to provide grass roots as well as virtual leadership to this information revolution. These volunteers are addressing issues in education, health, employment, water and agriculture to help underdeveloped communities. \r\n\r\nHarsha, former Asha Mumbai coordinator, started his activism by giving up mainstream job in 2003, exploring entrepreneurial opportunities in social development sector with new ideas. He co-founded the organization Ek Gaav Ek Sanganak (One Village One Computer-/1v1c) with Anil Shaligram, leading journalist and activist in Maharashtra. Anil is now â€œAshoka fellow for social entrepreneurshipâ€ for 1v1c idea and work. This project was Maharashtra foundation (US) initiative in the period Jan 2003 -March 2006. \r\n\r\nHarsha has now formed network called ITforSocialChange which acts with networking philosophy and ideology. This is turning out to be new movement of the youth working to build India as knowledge economy. Harsha sees his â€˜knowledgeâ€™ activism as very natural evolution of thinking Asha volunteer, who tries to understand everything about socio-economic change in his Asha exposure and makes attempts to move fast on learning curve. \r\n\r\n', 'One Village One Computer', '', 'To lead the knowledge and information revolution in villages by means of developing virtual & grass root leaderships, encouraging social networking activism by creating India-wide scalable and replicable enterprise for solving peopleâ€™s developmental problems.

The workshop was open to young adults in the age group of 15 and above, who are participating in vocational training classes or are looking to make the decision. The seed idea for the workshop came about at the Kolkata conference when participating organizations commented on limits to vocational training a single organization can provide. Additionally, teenagers often do not know what options are available, and exposure opportunities would go a long way to help them make informed decisions. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of the Delhi workshop were: \r\n\r\n1: Exposure to vocational training modules and variations in training methods. If skill already exists, then ways to gain edge over competition. \r\n\r\n2: Promote proactive resource sharing among NGO/govt agencies dealing with adolescent skills training. \r\n\r\n3: Informal life skills discussion (a moderated discussion among themselves on flexible framework of topics) \r\n\r\nProfile of participants: Around 40 teenagers participated from Prayas,  Abhas, and  from Navshrishti\r\n\r\nThese youngsters are taking vocational training and also attending schools.  Many of them are enrolled with National Institute of Open School and will be taking either their 8th, 10th, or 12th class exam.  \r\n\r\nAsha Delhi volunteer Rohini Muthuswami lead the discussions with the host organizations and represented Asha for Education at the event.', '', 'A Below are excerpts of Rohini''s notes from the event.\r\n\r\nDay 1:  \r\n\r\nSession 1: Life skills\r\n\r\nThe morning session was devoted to life skill module which was very participatory.  We talked about what are life skills, how we learn them, what makes a successful person- we talked about giving respect as well as self-respect, communication skills, assertiveness, how to be polite...it was probably a lot crammed into a short time. But as we gave them an overview of the workshop, we realized that many of them did not even know what vocational training was. \r\n\r\nSession 2: Hands on vocational exposure:\r\n\r\nThe afternoon session was devoted to hands-on training on making greeting cards.  They did this with ordinary paper and the workshop stretched to 4.30pm.  By then the teenagers were tired.  The instructor had bought stiff greeting card paper, but decided not to use that but instead to call it a day. Maybe we can do just another session another time for it. \r\n\r\nDay 2:\r\n\r\nSession 1: Life Skills\r\n\r\nThe presenter was Mr. Junaid Mirza who works with Abhas.  He started with introductions but with a twist.  Every one had to introduce themselves and then say one positive quality about themselves that starts with their initial.  So introduced himself as Jolly Junaid.  The class was stunned.   \r\n\r\nThe first girl told him that she has no positive quality so how can she describe herself.  He was relentless. â€˜You have to describe yourself but I will give you timeâ€™, he said to her.  He went on to the next girl who hesitantly said that she is always smiling and her name is Manju. He dubbed her as Muskurati Manju.  He went down the row.  By then the first girl got enough courage to say that she wins everyone''s heart and that her name is Meenu.  So he said she was Manmohati Meenu.   \r\n\r\nAnd so it went through the girls. Finally when everyone was done, he said that they will have to set the rules for the session. So the class started, again very hesistant:\r\n\r\n1. Punctuality 2. Listening carefully 3. Respect everyone 4. We will try to follow whatever is taught in this class. 5. We will raise our hands if we have a question 6. We will not make fun of each other when they ask questions that might seem stupid. 7. We will cooperate with each other 8. We will try to achieve the goals for this class. 9. Finally, we will maintain confidentiality if anyone shares with us, in this class, something that happened to them. \r\n\r\nAfter this he talked what are life skills and the 10 life skills that WHO has defined: 1. Self-awareness; 2. Empathy; 3. Effective communication; 4. Decision making; 5. Creative thinking; 6. Critical thinking; 7. Problem solving skills; 8. Interpersonal relationship; 9. Coping with stress; 10 Coping with emotions. \r\n\r\nAs he went through each, he used examples that the girls would be familiar with.  Like situation in the house.  Their brother might be married and the relationship that they might have with their bhabhi.  He touched upon the fact that girls have to make the maximum decisions in life but they never have control over it.  And how through these life skills they can attempt to get some control over it.  He talked about sexual harassment they might face from people they know- for example he might be a person from their bhabhi''s village who is now staying with them and he is touching them inappropriately.  What should they do then?  One of the boys said, that the girl should give him one hard slap.  Which, he said was right, but what happens if the bhabhi comes to know of it?  What if she tells it her husband, the girl''s brother?  How to deal with the situation? \r\n\r\nAt the end of this part, he asked them to write down three of the life skills they use in their life on a daily basis, and three life skills that they do not use.  Almost everyone said they use decision making everyday. Many said that they never used Self-awareness and coping with emotions. \r\n\r\nThe next part started with story telling.  He told two fables: The crow and the pitcher; and the monkey and the crocodile.  After the end of each of the story, he asked them to list which of the life skill technique was used in that story. \r\n\r\nThe class was having problems with understanding few concepts like Empathy.  So he said that they will enact short plays.  he called for volunteers but no one was ready to come forward.  He cajoled them by saying that only those people volunteer who are brave.  Four girls stood up and they were given a situation to enact.  This was to demonstrate empathy.  The situation was that the girl had failed in her exam and she tells her sister.  There are different ways in which the sister reacts.  The class was asked which was the best way?  Then the girls who were enacting the part of having failed were asked how they felt in each situation. \r\n\r\nFinally, he talked about how can we communicate more effectively (concentrative listening, empathy, honesty, understanding, and consoling).  Again at the end he called for volunteers to enact situations.  This time the response was just amazing!  There were more volunteers than needed.   \r\n\r\nHe also talked for few minutes how to react when pressure is being put on you.  For example, the boys might be under peer-pressure from others to smoke.  The girl might be friendly with a boy who might pressure her to come to the cinema alone with him, and this might be a trap.  So he taught them how to avoid such situations. \r\n\r\nThe class enjoyed this session much more than yesterday and told him so.  At the end of the class, there was a spontaneous ovation from them. \r\n\r\nSession 2: Hands on vocational exposure:\r\n\r\nThis session focused on  â€œhands- on training session on electricity and handling of simple equipments in day to day scenarioâ€. \r\n\r\nThis session included hands on work wiring a lamp, changing light bulbs and changing a fuse. Along with doing this, discussions were held about conservation of energy, kinds of light bulbs etc. Safety and care in the use of electrical appliances was discussed. \r\n\r\nThe workshop was, overall, successful from the young adults point of view. We will keep building on the idea and in the process encourage greater sharing across organizations. Exposure to alternative ideas and ways of thinking is key for the youth to encourage them to be creative and resourceful in solving their day to day problems. It is important for them to realize what is within their capacity and through that gain greater control over their lives.', '', 'http://www.prayaschildren.org/', '', 0x30, 'prayas@del6.vsnl.net.in', '', 2, '59, Tughlakabad Institutional Area', '', 0, 'New Delhi', 0, 7, 2, '110 062', '(11) 29955505, (11) 29956244', '', 0, NULL, 'Rajib K.

However, poorer sections of society often do not have access to adequate preventive or prescriptive healthcare for a variety of reasons. Consequently, a major medical event in a poor family can cause serious devastation, especially if the individual who falls ill is the bread-winner in the family. These poorer sections of society are deprived of access to healthcare services for a variety of reasons: (1) they are not knowledgeable enough to navigate the healthcare system, (2) have no familial support, or (3) do not have money for treatment.  Even if they do have these three things, often times they will have to take out loans which can plunge the family deeper into poverty â€“ and may prevent them from ever recovering.  In Lucknow and the surrounding areas, there are many such people who face these issues.  Manish has been a strong and efficient advocate of these people for the past year and has earned respect from not only the patients, but also the physicians, nurses, and government officers who bring needy patients to Manish. \r\n\r\n\r\nClearly describe the proposed solution:\r\n\r\nThere are three major reasons why these people do not have access to healthcare services, and Manishâ€™s work addresses each of these three reasons:\r\n\r\n(1)	Inadequate knowledge of the healthcare system: Manish over the past year has built a network of physicians, nurses, and doctors who provide a support structure for this work. This network includes physicians who will treat patients for free or at minimal costs, as well as individuals who provide medication to Manish for these patients at minimal or no cost. Over the past year, he has developed a strong knowledge of healthcare procedures such as lab tests and the most common medications for the type of patients who need his help (burn victims, mental patients, etc.) Furthermore, Manish has a very strong knowledge of where to get what and has become extremely efficient in getting the necessary materials and services for a patient with a given ailment. \r\n\r\n(2)	Little or no familial support: In addition to getting medications, lab tests, and a place in the hospital, Manish helps find families of destitute patients, and if no family member can be found, he provides them with support throughout their stay in the healthcare system, brings them food, and then if necessary finds them shelter in government facilities. \r\n \r\n(3)	Little or no financial resources for healthcare expenses: Because of Manishâ€™s long relationship with Asha as a Volunteer, financial resources for more expensive medical treatments can be procured if necessary. Furthermore, Manish has built up a strong set of local donors who will either help him financially or with medical supplies for the patients. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe expected impact:\r\n\r\nThere are several a clear and positive impacts of Manishâ€™s work:\r\n\r\n(1)	The 10-20 patients that Manish helps per month either do not die or do not end up with life-long disabilities which results in many spill-over effects for the families and communities.\r\n(2)	Awareness about these patients in both the local community as well as members of the healthcare system will be raised, which will improve the provision of healthcare to these people. \r\n\r\nDescribe any innovative ideas & approach:\r\n\r\nThe idea of a healthcare advocate which will help poor patients navigate the system is in itself very innovative.  Manish has other ideas for keeping a cabinet in each of the wards of the medical college hospital in Lucknow, which will store the most utilized medications and products for the patients he helps treat. This will make treatment more efficient and will ensure that even if Manish is not there at that moment, the nurses or doctors can take the medication out of the cabinet when a patient who does not have the resources needs treatment. \r\n\r\nClearly describe why you will succeed:\r\n\r\n1.	Manishâ€™s work has been running for over a year, and his involvement in healthcare activities has been going on for some time now â€“ resulting in many lives saved, including those of Asha volunteers such as Laxmi Narayan. \r\n2.	Manish is a extremely trustworthy and financially conservative volunteer (which allows him to make use of his resources in the best possible way) with a proven track-record of good work with Asha. \r\n3.	There is significant and natural demand for his services and a strong network of support from the healthcare community in Lucknow, especially at the Medical College.\r\n\r\nWhat activites will be undertaken for the project:\r\n\r\nâ€¢	Help needy patients navigate the healthcare system \r\nâ€¢	Provide support during their sickness\r\nâ€¢	Procure necessary funds and supplies for the patient so they do not go into perpetual debt\r\n\r\nHow will the impact of the work be measured (data collection, interviews, etc.):\r\n\r\nâ€¢	Manish has already been keeping an immaculate record of the patients he has been helping. This record includes the patientâ€™s name, their illness, the tests ordered, the procedures performed, the medications purchased, and when and where the patient was treated. \r\nâ€¢	Manish also keeps extremely detailed and in my view a very honest financial record of his expenditures for all his activities including petrol, bus, medications, tests, and other expenditures incurred for his work. \r\n\r\n', 'Asha Health Service', 'Asha Lalpur/Lucknow chapter volunteers run this healthcare activity in collboartion with the lucknow government medical college and police department.

Total health care spending in India is roughly 6% of total GPD that translates to between $220-250 per capita (in comparison US spends between $7000-$8500 per capita) (1,2). However in India, unlike US, a major portion (85%) is paid for directly by the patient. As a result, poorer sections of societies in India that live hand-to-mouth go without adequate access to healthcare. In addition to economic reasons, low awareness about medical conditions and the healthcare system in far-away cities, lack of medical facilities, and shortage of qualified medical practitioners in rural India make the problem even worse. These multiple factors lead to diseases going undiagnosed and untreated until they reach late stage and when patients require urgent medical care. Consequently, a major medical event in a poor family can cause serious devastation, especially if the individual who falls ill is the breadwinner in the family. Medical loans taken for treatment can often plunge the family deeper into poverty â€“ and may prevent them from ever recovering. Lucknow and the surrounding rural areas is one of thousands of such places in India where people face these issues. Manish, an Asha Healthcare Fellow, has been a strong and efficient advocate of these people for the past two years and has earned respect from not only the patients, but also physicians, nurses, and government officers who bring needy patients to Manish.\r\n\r\n\r\n1) http://www.nchc.org/facts/cost.shtml\r\n2) http://www.sociology.org/content/vol8.1/deogaonkar.html\r\n\r\n\r\nProposed solution:\r\n\r\nWhile there are many places in the healthcare system that need help from Non-governmental organizations, Ashaâ€™s work is strategically focused on areas where we determined most impact for our donorâ€™s funds. As such, Asha Chicago is providing funds to support Manishâ€™s fellowship in the area of healthcare. Manishâ€™s work as a Healthcare Advocate is focused to address the following three areas of greatest need:\r\n\r\n(1)	Network and knowledge building to provide affordable healthcare access for poor: - Manish over the past two years has brought awareness and built network with physicians, nurses, and laboratory staff who provide a support for his work. Manish leverages this network by bringing needy patients to physicians who will treat patients for free or at minimal costs and hospital staff who will provide medication to Manish for these patients at minimal cost. Furthermore, Manish has a very strong knowledge of where to go for reliable, cheap, and quick access to medicines and laboratory tests â€“ especially those that are used most frequently. \r\n\r\n(2)	Support during hospital stay and rehabilitation upon discharge: In addition to getting medications, lab tests, and a place in the hospital, Manish helps find families of destitute patients, and if no family member can be found, he provides them with support throughout their stay in the healthcare system, brings them food, and then if necessary finds them shelter in government facilities.\r\n\r\n(3)	Fundraising to pay for healthcare expenses: The third area of focus for Manish is to procure financial resources for more expensive medical treatments. As a long time volunteer with Asha, Manish has built relationship with local donors in Lucknow who help him financially or with medical supplies for the patients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe expected impact:\r\n\r\nThere are several a clear and positive impacts of Manishâ€™s work:\r\n\r\n(1)	Manish helps between 10-20 patients per month. Because of kind of conditions his patients suffer from â€“ his assistance can sometime mean the difference between life or death, good recovery or life-long disability. A negative patient outcome can lead to many spillover effects for the families and communities.\r\n\r\n(2)	Increased awareness about these patients in both the local community as well as members of the healthcare system that will improve the provision of healthcare to these people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe any innovative ideas & approach:\r\n\r\nThe idea of a Healthcare Advocate who will help poor patients navigate the system and assist during treatment is in itself very innovative in Lucknow. Other ideas Manish has to improve care for these patients include keeping a medicine cabinet in each ward of the medical college hospital in Lucknow. This cabinet will store the most utilized medications and products. This will make treatment more efficient and will ensure that access to medicines even if Manish is not at the hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow will the impact of the work be measured (data collection, interviews, etc.):\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Patient records: Manish keeps a detailed record of the patients he helps.

The uniqueness of this bill is in the fact that it carries emphasis on issues like equality of wages for men and women, elimination of work contracting/middlemen, payment of wages only through bank and post office accounts to prevent corruption, creating transparency in workers muster rolls etc. Any individual, irrespective of his socio-economic status can ask for employment (either in writing or verbally) with the Gram Panchayat.

There is a need to address education especially in the rural areas of this district. Shikshana Gangothri is an Integrated Education model focused at all 3 levels-Preschools, Schools, Adult', '<b>Project Geography:</b>\r\nShikshana Gangothri project is based out of Kolar District, one of the backward Districts of Karnataka. The project covers the following 2 geographical areas within the Kolar District:\r\n-	A part of the Kolar taluka namely the Hollur, having a population of 16,360. Kolar Taluka is in Kolar District in the western part of Karnataka. \r\n-	A part of the Gowribidanur Taluka namely Idagur, having a population of 26,755. Gowribidanur Taluka is in Kolar District in the western part of Karnataka.\r\nKolar District as whole, is a dry land with an average rainfall. There is no river in the district and people live on agriculture. The cultivation mainly depends on rainwater. There is a good number of SC/ST population who have taken to agriculture by profession. The problems are plenty and are mostly due to lack of education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Problem Definition:</b>\r\nKaruna Trust (our NGO Partner) based out of Bangalore, India, has worked for the last 2 decades and a half on development programs for the rural poor. Having begun with a program on leprosy control in Yelandur taluk, the trust progressed to other health issues, education and livelihoods in response to the needs that became evident to them as the years progressed. In the course of their work, they realized that the one factor that hampered real progress was the lack of convergence between the various departments of the government, even within specific areas such as health and education. These various departments since they were working as “line” departments confined their work to limited and narrow mandates and were therefore able to only achieve limited impact. It is this gap that Karuan Trust wanted to address. It was identified that a large section of adults in Kolar district who were illiterate had been at some point, victims of this lack of convergence. Their education had not been addressed holistically and had pre-primary, primary and high school education been working in synergy, these individuals might not have dropped out and might have been able to achieve at least a minimum level of literacy. It was also evident that the government could not address all development needs. There were some very good schemes and programs that were available, but it was in the implementation that there were gaps. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Solution Identification:</b>\r\nIt was clear that what was really required is the coming together of multi-stakeholders, who can work in partnership with the government to enable progress. For this, Karuna Trust saw public-private partnerships as viable and effective means to the end. Karuna Trust has attempted to facilitate just such a partnership in the Shikshana Gangothri project – an integrated approach to education. The solution called for innovative methods that would address each section separately, and yet enable convergence of all the initiatives at some point. The project was begun with the high-level objectives of:\r\n-	Eliminating residual illiteracy in the productive age group of 15-21 years and above.\r\n-	Ensuring that all the children in the age group of 0-3, 3-6 years are in the anganwadi system and accessing nutrition-based, cognitive development and ensuring 100 percent coverage in future.\r\n-	Ensuring that all the children in the age group of 6-9 and 10-14 years are in school and ensuring zero drop-out rate. \r\n-	Developing a model of integrated education cum literacy approach for sustainable development. \r\n\r\nThe solution pointed out to a need for involving the entire community in the education process. It was evident that merely getting children back into the school would address only part of the problem. Unless the entire community was sensitized to the importance of education and began to believe the education was a vital requirement for their children the problem of drop-outs would continue. If the community had to appreciate the value of education there had to be a minimum level of literacy among them. This led to the inclusion of adult literacy within the project. Addressing the pre-school and anganwadis came from the understanding that this was the most important phase in a child’s life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>The approach:</b>\r\nIn order to help sustain the child’s interest in school, it is important for Karuna Trust to work in partnership with teachers, SDMC (School Development Management Committees) members and other stakeholders in the education process to improve the overall quality of education. It envisaged utilizing the following:\r\n-	The existing infrastructure (material and personnel) of Karuna Trust (6 dedicated staff) in Karuna Trust\r\n-	The resource strength of State Resource Center – Karnataka in adult literacy programs\r\n-	The district government machinery – adult education (Zilla Sakshara Samithi), primary education (department of education and Sarva Shiksha Abiyana), Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) and Balvikas Samithis which runs the anganwadi centers\r\n-	The Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs)\r\n-	The community as a whole\r\n-	Other resource groups and interest groups such as Asha\r\nLast but not the least, the value of this program lies in the fact that it is easily replicable and Karuna Trust hopes that the other agencies/state could pick up the concept and enable ‘education for all’ in the same manner as ‘Shikshana Gangothri’.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Summary: Shikshana Gangothri in a snap-shot</b>  \r\nProject Objectives:\r\n-	Create an integrated model of education, health care and livelihood for under-privileged\r\n-	Work through Public/Private Partnership with Public Schools/Government organizations\r\n-	Focus at 3 levels of education – Pre-schools, Primary & Adult\r\n-	Replicate the ‘Samgara Shikshana’ Project (Integrated Education) implemented in Yelandur Taluk (eg: BR Hills School) \r\n\r\n\r\nProject Highlights:\r\n-	Dr. Sudarshan (Padma Sri receiver) as overall coordinator of Karuna Trust \r\n-	5 year implementation plan (Project in 3rd yr.)\r\n-	33 schools, 133 teachers, 3128 students (1601 males, 1527 females, travel avg. 2 to 4 kms) plus 25 anganwadis with the objective to enroll all new-born, 0-6 year kids.\r\n-	Asha’s financial support is approx. $10,000/yr\r\n-	Supports 6 volunteers, teacher/skill training, capacity building, School restructuring, materials for children\r\n-	Directly affecting one of the backward and drought prone districts, that has high SC and ST population\r\n\r\n\r\nKey Issues Monitored for Solutions:\r\n-	Child Attendance: Work with Teachers/Parents\r\n-	Teacher Absenteeism: Identify cause/help as Substitute Teachers\r\n-	Monthly Review Meetings/Solutions: School Principals, Gram Panchayat, Teachers, Parents \r\n-	Meals: Monitor Food Quality/Kitchen hygiene\r\n-	Toilets/Water Tanks: Monitor Cleanliness\r\n-	Anganwadis: Supplements, Post Natal Nutrition, Check for weak children, take necessary actions\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn on Investment Calculation/Metrics Tracking:\r\n- Annual Cost per student (2009-2010) \r\n= $10,000 (Dollar Amount) Divided by 3128 (Number of Students)\r\n= $3.20 per Child = Rs. 170 per Child\r\n- Plan to Define Metrics/Quarterly Measurements\r\n- Reduction in Dropout Rate \r\n- Increase in New School Admissions\r\n- Teacher Absenteeism Reduction\r\n- Student Attendance Improvement\r\n- Improvement in number of Toilets per School\r\n- Reduction in number of Sick Students \r\n- Objective Feedback from School Principals/Teachers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>References:</b>\r\nBooks - \r\nDr. Bharathi Ghanshyam (2008).

He had a road accident and suffered severe head injuries while driving his motorcycle on the Bangalore/Hyderabad National Highway near his residence in Chennekothapalle village of Anantapur district.\r\n\r\nMutyalappa was nominated as a Asha fellow in mid-2007 to support his work as a Sarpanch of Mushtikovela panchayat in Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh. His extensive previous work with the NGO Timbaktu Collective laid a solid grounding for him to undertake village development work as Sarpanch. He made Mushtikovela panchayat an outstanding example of NREGA implementation, with more than 1 crore rupees in cumulative disbursements to labourers. His most recent project which was just reaching completion at the time of his demise was the optimal utilization of Mushtikovela''s tank through a process of consensus and dialoguing, so that a crop of paddy could be taken even in a drought year, creating significant income for the village. \r\n\r\nMutyalappa was a highly dynamic individual who understood the system and decided to work within it, by entering the political arena at the village level. Despite tremendous pressure and continuing difficulties he worked for proper implementation of government schemes for the benefit of the village. In interactions with him, his tremendous capacity to mobilize people, put pressure on the government to make the will of the people prevail came through clearly. He had an amazing talent in negotiating the delicate terrain of caste, political, personal and other divides in a village to get people together to achieve something of value. It is tragic that a person like him met an untimely demise while he had much more to contribute. The circumstances of his death were also unfortunate as he was shuttled between hospitals and places in a desperate attempt to find appropriate emergency treatment. \r\n\r\nHe is survived by his wife, a young son and an elder brother.

He has been working for the past 7 years (1999 to 2006) in positions of increasing responsibility with an NGO called Timbaktu Collective. \r\n\r\nTimbaktu Collective is a long standing partner of Asha since 1995. Mutyalappa has had varied experience in all aspects of village development during his work with Timbaktu Collective.  He Started off by working in Natural Resource Management program in Kambalapalli of Roddam mandal. The work was to strengthen the Forest Committes (Vana Samrakshana Samitis), and support their activities. After that, he worked for the Anantashakti Mutually Aided Thrift Co-operative Society promoted by the Collective as a thrift  worker. His work involved collection of thrift payments and organising and strengthening womens'' groups. In April 2000, he joined the Panchayati Raj program. This work involved training and awareness building of Panchayati Raj functionaries (Sarpanches, Secretaries, ward members and CBO leaders) on the powers and responsibilities of Panchayati Raj institutions. He then worked in Yuvatha, (youth program) and Militha (work with the disabled). From 2002 to 2004, he was in charge of the Collective''s Watershed program in Roddam mandal. The work involved organising user groups and women''s groups, strengthening the groups and providing training inputs. After that he continued to work in leadership roles as program co-ordinator and Mandal leader, and spent some time in the central co-ordination group too. Besides, he was contributor for 2 years and editor for 8 months of "Mungari", the internal newsletter of Timbaktu Collective. \r\n\r\nAs sarpanch of Mushtikovela village, Mutyalappa has a strong vision to set a model of how a Panchayat can and should work. The Panchayat functioning in Mushtikovela has been dysfunctional, something that is true across Anantapur and other parts of the country. The programmes of the Panchayat have not been implemented properly and the development of the village is therefore low. As Sarpanch Mutyalappa intends to implement his vision in the following ways:\r\n\r\n1) to hold the Panchayat and Gram Sabha meetings regularly, maintain proper office, records and books of accounts, implement all available government schemes and run the Panchyat in a transparent fashion\r\n2) to pay special attention to NREGA works which if implemented properly are a significant source of income to the very poor and landless, and develop the village assets at the same time.\r\n3) Participate in the meetings of Community Based Organisations: SHGs (Self Help Groups), VO (Village Officers) , PTA (Parent Teacher Association) etc. The better is the co-ordination between these groups amongst themselves and between them and the Panchayat, the better chance there is for development programs to reach their full potential. \r\n4) To base his long-term plan for the development of the village (Sarpanch post is for 5 years) on progress in the following key areas: Education, Sanitation, Agriculture, NRM, Women and Child Development, Livelihood Promotion, Transparency in governance\r\n\r\nSince the Sarpanch post is a honorary one with a honorarium of Rs 600/- p.m., it would not possible for Mutyalappa (or any Sarpanch who is not independently wealthy) to devote his full attention to the job without taking up another job for livelihood. Therefore he applied for, and was approved for a fellowship which would enable him to focus his full attention to his Sarpanch role.\r\n', 'Past Affiliation to Timbaktu Collective', 'There is no specific organization involved.

In its present state, the school has come a long way from mere functional literacy; it has developed adequate infrastructure and stability to strive for academic excellence and infusing quality education, in complete harmony with the community and environment of the children. Educators at VSB have experimented with methods of classroom teaching and learning (like group-learning practices),  developed audio-visual aides for effectively teaching subjects like Science, History and Geography. The children are regularly involved in activities that help build communion with nature, and are given classes in various performing arts and sports, apart from the regular subjects. VSB also makes a conscious effort to attract more students from the most-economically-disadvantaged families, by offering reduced tuition fees, fee-waivers, scholarships and free books for children from families living below the poverty line.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs of the 2007-2008 academic year, VSB has 479 students on roll from Nursery to class IX. The staff includes 22 teachers, a headmistress, 4 non-teaching staff, and 2 administrative coordinators. The school has newly added class IX in the current academic session (2007-2008), and plans to extend to class X in the coming year.', 'Ushagram Trust', 'History of the Ushagram Trust and foundation of the school :\r\n\r\nGopal Chandra Chakravarty, the founder of the Ushagram Trust, purchased a piece of consolidated but fallow land in the year 1968 and embarked on the mission of setting up a Tapoban type Ashramic Vidyalaya for children as well as for the socio-economic\r\ndevelopment of the people around. A free Primary School was set up under improvised sheds in the year 1974 for\r\nimparting education to the children of the locality, where school-going habits never existed before. This marked the inception of VSB. As a sequel to the\r\npartition of the country, the original residents left the place for East Pakistan and uprooted families from East Pakistan\r\n(now Bangladesh) settled in these areas.\r\n\r\nIn order to give a practical shape to Sri Aurobindoâ€™s vision of building a community with higher consciousness gnostic\r\nsociety, Ushagram Trust, a non-political, non-profit-making rural voluntary organization, was formed in the year 1980. The thrust area of the activities of the trust is education, yet the Board of Trustees, from the very beginning, simultaneously took up rural development program to generate favorable response of the disadvantaged community including some long-felt needs of the local people.\r\n\r\nCurrently, under the umbrella of its education programs, Ushagram Trust runs VSB, 12 Balwadis (pre-school and primary learning centers), and a children''s hostel. It also runs the State Open School (Rabindra Mukta Vidyalaya) - a major center for non-formal higher education, the Ushagram Gramin Library and book bank, and a adult literacy program.\r\n\r\nAs far as the logistics go, a Coordinator and Assistant Coordinator form the bridge between the School and the Trust. The school administration is taken care of by the School Board.', 'The minimum skill-set and knowledge-base to be acquired by the children of VSB is stated as being able to do the following independently without much of difficulty:\r\na) To read and comprehend the main news items of a vernacular newspaper.\r\nb) To read and understand the main columns /data items of municipal records, land records, birth certificates,\r\ncitizenship/voter-id cards, bank passbooks or statement, advertisements in print media through his/her mother-tongue.\r\nc) To apply the knowledge-base so acquired in daily life.\r\nd) To earn her/his livelihood by engaging successfully in any trade or vocational occupation taught through the school curriculum.\r\ne) To have general understanding and knowledge about health issues like AIDS, TB, arsenic poisoning, immunization\r\netc.\r\nf) To have general knowledge about socio-political and cultural issues.\r\n\r\nThe school follows the curriculum (and main textbooks) prescribed the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, supplementing the basic framework by their own methods of classroom teaching including laboratories, teaching aides and instruments, off-classroom activities, nature camps, and vocational training.\r\n\r\nAsha for Education, Central NJ, in constant dialogue with the school board, decided to focus on the following major areas, for furthering the cause of underprivileged children in the community:\r\n1) Encouraging increased enrollment of children from the poorest sections of the community.\r\n2) Addressing the problem of low retention of students in the higher classes (by completing the extension till class X).\r\n3) General development and sustenance of the school.\r\n\r\nBased on the above goals, several action items have been decided upon, for which funds have been sanctioned for the current academic year:\r\n1) Introduction of mid-day meal for students.\r\n2) Books, stationary and sets of uniform, free of cost, to the  students who cannot otherwise afford them.\r\n3) Gradual increment in teachers'' salaries on a yearly basis, to bring it to to an acceptable level.\r\n4) Camps for the children, and Orientation/training programs for teachers.\r\n5) Story books for children.\r\n\r\nTotal funds sanctioned (to be disbursed by August 2007): $6400 (recurring) and $1500 (one-time).\r\nFunds are to be given in 2 installments, amounts of which are to be determined by project stewards in consultation with the school board.

Agriculture is in a bad state with repeated crop failures and incidence of farmer suicides. \r\nThe status of women in Anantapur district is quite bad. Women lag behind in education, skills, ownership of assets/property, mobility, and are subjected to domestic violence which is taken for granted. Presence of domestic violence hurts welfare and progress of the children, families and the community. Changing this culture is a long process that will require widespread work through several avenues.\r\n\r\nIn such a situation, an institutional structure like the MACT (Mutually Aided Co-operative Thrift) Societies run by Timbaktu Collective that provide economical opportunities to women and family counseling/legal help and refuge in times of distress and crisis is very much needed. The MACTS have been providing these services to its members. There were 92 interventions undertaken during 2005-06 financial year, besides two major social actions by MATCS to help women members. Evidently, there is a dire need for legal and family counseling that can impact the well being of families. B. Sireesha, lawyer by profession, has been leading this effort with the support of the MATCS.\r\n\r\nThe situation requires people with training and field experience in law, counseling, and conflict resolution. There is a critical need to continue and expand these services and at the same time build a pool of legal and para-legal workers with the same skills to extend legal counseling and help to other areas in the district. Instead problems must be caught at an early stage. Availability of more full-time paralegals or counselors for discussions and guidance on an everyday basis also helps the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, the MACT Societies are transitioning to a model of self-sufficiency (outside funding will be stopped in 2007), and are unable to continue to provide full support for family and legal counseling to its women members in the immediate future. However, the societies are very clear about the value of the broader social services like the family counseling provided to the members and other public. So, during this transition period as the Societies stabilize it will be very useful to continue support the family and legal counseling by finding different avenues or support opputunities.\r\n', 'Timbaktu Collective', 'The Timbaktu Collective is a registered voluntary organisation that was initiated in 1990, to work for sustainable development in the drought prone Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh, India.

Another aspect is to train full-time legal workers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe current practice is to involve or resolve after the situation has reached a flashpoint. Now, it is intended to continue, expand and improve the current services provided by the MACTS. This is achieved by visiting the field offices of each mandal every week to listen to the new cases that have come up, and decide the action to be taken in each case. It is planned to organize counseling sessions where appropriate with the participation of the involved parties,  MACT Society functionaries and police where necessary, and mediate the discussions and drive them towards a satisfactory conclusion. It is planned to organize follow up meetings to make sure things are continuing on the right track. In more serious cases it is intended to work with members of Timbaktu Collective to initiate legal action or organize mass action to highlight heinous crimes.\r\n\r\nRecently, the Timbaktu Collective has been given responsibility under Lok Adalat by which it is authorized to deal with and dispose off local cases with support of the legal authorities. Sireeshaâ€™s continued involvement with the Collective will be helpful in this regard. \r\n\r\nImpact:\r\n\r\nLegal and family counseling help women resolve family disputes and curb domestic violence. When this is coupled with economical uplift, it would contribute to the well-being of the families and communities. This provides a good environment for the children. Counseling is also expected to improve self-confidence of women, and counseling as a community activity creates a sense of solidarity among the women to work together to solve their problems.

Asha funds teachers conducting the programme and libraries that supplement learning activities.', 'Introduction\r\n--------------\r\nThe Balavihar project is designed for providing holistic education and improving quality of English language learning for urban lower middle class children enrolled in poorly equipped urban schools. Many government schools lack trained staff for teaching English language (in some cases the English teacher is not capable of speaking English). In many of these schools children are often subject to ''rote learning'' and the learning process is confined to the material present in the textbooks. In addition to degrading the quality of education, such a process allows no room for children to explore their curiosity and express their creativity. As a result children tend to lose interest in learning. The project attempts to addresses some of these issues through activity based non-formal learning programs.\r\n\r\nIn government schools, the primary focus of the program is to improve quality of English language learning. In private schools, the primary goal is to make learning an enjoyable activity, thereby helping children express their creativity. The learning programs in all of the schools are supplemented and supported by small libraries.\r\n\r\nInfrastructure\r\n--------------\r\nThe infrastructure for the project mainly consists of basic library furniture, books and other learning materials stocked in the libraries. One of the libraries is housed in the project coordinator''s home and remaining are located in a dedicated room in the participating private schools. The learning activities are held either in classrooms or in dedicated ''activity rooms'' in the participating schools. The participating schools have provided these rooms for free. \r\n\r\nPrograms\r\n---------\r\nAs of June 2008 the project covers six schools. \r\n\r\nThe English language training program is conducted in four government schools. The program consists of exercises in reading comprehension, writing, speaking, conversations, listening to stories and songs. To help children develop English speaking skills, an audio CD (developed by Center for Training Excellence Bangalore) is also being used. The CD consists of stories and conversations that students listen and repeat (the government schools have computers!). In addition to the English training, the instructors have also started introducing other non-formal learning activities such as needlework, drawing, indoor games and puzzles in the government schools.\r\n\r\nNon formal learning activities are regularly conducted in two private schools. Examples of activities are:\r\n* Songs, chants and yogasanas\r\n* Creative writing, poetry writing\r\n* Making puppets, simple toys,games\r\n* Art and craft activities\r\n* Drama and theatre activities\r\n* Clay work\r\n\r\nStaff\r\n-----\r\nThere are nine teachers in the program. Asha supports  two full-time and two part-time teachers. The remaining are volunteers. Although the project covers more than six hundred students all of the programs are conducted for small groups of 20-30 students to allow the instructors to provide individualized attention and care.The monthly reports provide a full description of the activities and time table of the program in each of the schools.\r\n\r\nAsha''s support\r\n--------------\r\nThe project is almost entirely financed by Asha. The recurring expenses are salaries for teachers, conveyance for teachers, and periodic procurement of books and other learning material. Initial expenses include books procurement and basic furniture for libraries.', 'Covenant Center for Development', 'Covenant Center for Development (CCD) is a Madurai based non-profit organization.

Our work is presently restricted to our first test bed â€“ Rasoolpura Slum in Hyderabad.\r\n\r\nOur development model works on four specific domains to deliver Holistic and Sustainable Transformation. \r\nOur domains are \r\nâ€“ Education\r\nâ€“ Livelihood\r\nâ€“ Health Care\r\nâ€“ Water, Environment and Sanitation.\r\n\r\nInterventions in the above mentioned domains will be designed to deliver a better quality of life to the communities we work with. Since its inception in 2006, Bhumi has started several initiatives in the aforementioned domains and partnered with numerous other NGOs to mobilize resources to achieve their goals. Their â€œFreedom Construction â€œ initiative, helped by 150 volunteers from various walks of life has helped rebuild the Government school in Rasoolpura slums of Hyderabad. At the stroke of mid night on 15th August, an old dilapidated school building was brought down, the school grounds were cleared of garbage and filth, the rubble was used to level the school play ground.

The high dedication of Balwadi teachers, helping to run these centers with abysmally low salary deserve a special mention.\r\n\r\nAs of the 2008-2009 academic year, these centers all together have about 350 students, the number is down from 478 students in previous year (mostly indicating a successful family planning program in the region) and 24 teachers.\r\n', 'Ushagram Trust', 'History of the Ushagram Trust and foundation of the school :\r\n\r\nGopal Chandra Chakravarty, the founder of the Ushagram Trust, purchased a piece of consolidated but fallow land in the year 1968 and embarked on the mission of setting up a Tapoban type Ashramic Vidyalaya for children as well as for the socio-economic\r\ndevelopment of the people around. A free Primary School was set up under improvised sheds in the year 1974 for\r\nimparting education to the children of the locality, where school-going habits never existed before. This marked the inception of VSB. As a sequel to the\r\npartition of the country, the original residents left the place for East Pakistan and uprooted families from East Pakistan\r\n(now Bangladesh) settled in these areas.\r\n\r\nCurrently, under the umbrella of its education programs, Ushagram Trust runs VSB, 12 Balwadis (pre-school and primary learning centers, some of which were established as early as in 1984-85, more centers being set up in rather recent years), and a children''s hostel. It also runs the State Open School (Rabindra Mukta Vidyalaya) - a major center for non-formal higher education, the Ushagram Gramin Library and book bank, and a adult literacy program.\r\n\r\nAs far as the logistics go, a Coordinator and Assistant Coordinator form the bridge between the School and the Trust. \r\n', 'a) To ensure that less number of drop-out cases occur at the primary and secondary level of schooling. \r\nb) To ensure that the children acquire the basic pre-primary education skills, e.g., identifying numbers, letters, etc.\r\nc) To create a better working condition for parents, especially mothers, by taking care of their children.\r\nd) To strengthen trust of the people in the locality (which is largely in place to begin with) so that other projects of UT like micro-credit programmes, women''s self-help group etc. become more successful.\r\n\r\nThe centers follow study materials which have been found to be suitable and appropriate for the concerned age group.

The mentally challenged children were tied outside their houses with chains or confined in the four walls of their houses; these children were living lives worse than animals.

Thousands of people were killed and more than 150,000 people were displaced and living in relief camps. The riots continued for six months and people were segregated in many colonies. The whole atmosphere was of suspicion and uncertainity. In this situation people could not think of sending their children to schools because of insecurity. Hundreds of children dropped out from schools. Many families shifted far away from their original living place to newly built relief colonies build by religious organizations. Means of livelihood were destroyed; economic boycott and polarization of communities snatched their livelihood resources. The families became divided and their lives were disturbed in all facets.

Education of children was completely lacking in all these areas as most of the children did not go to schools and were drop outs. CfD started education centres for these children and also integrated peace building alongside by taking equal mix of children of both Dalit & Muslim communities in the centres.

The ERC will act as a conduit to provide quality inputs to secondary education and also create pressures for bringing in several secondary curricula instead of just one now. \r\n</ol>\r\nWhen Comet Media Foundation of Mumbai offered us the education mela <b>â€œBal Vividhaâ€</b> to organise it in Kolkata,  we accepted the offer inspite of our very weak and  nebulous urban presence. The reason is that this fits into the aims of Shikshamitra as follows \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>We shall target the Bengali medium govt schools of Kolkata which cater to predominantly the urban slum and lower middle class children. And today their learning achievements are terrible. The overall quality and methods used are so inappropriate. The teachers and students will participate in the mela, learn some new things. More importantly they will get a taste of how different things can be. Hopefully this will lead to a demand for quality inputs. And future â€œclientsâ€ for the ERC.\r\n<li>Through this mela, which we have re-christened <b>â€œHarek Rakam Baâ€</b>, we hope to bring together a large number of innovative-resourceful teachers, trainers, other creative persons, institutions who can contribute fresh ideas and quality inputs to secondary education. This networking is one of the essential aims of Shikshamitra. The mela, in one shot, will enable us to do that and also see these persons and institutions in action. \r\n<li><b>For us the REAL work will start once the mela is over.

According to this assumption there are 63000 mentally retarded children & adults in Ajmer district. Most of the mentally retarded children are being denied their basic right to education.\r\n\r\nMental Retardation refers to significantly, sub average general intellectual functioning resulting in or associated with concurrent impairments in adaptive behaviour and manifested during the development period (Definition of American Association of Mentally Retardation Grossman 1983). It is a condition that describes children and adult who are limited in their ability to learn. They are socially immature. It characterizes an inability to participate meaningfully in play with other children. Mentally Retarded Children have inadequate adaptive skills like communication, self help, social and academic skills.\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of Mental Retardation is estimated to be approximately 3% of the population. Approximately 75% of diagnosed Mentally Retarded persons are of mild category and rest of 25% are distributed into moderate, severe and profound categories. Nearly 10% of people with Mental Retardation have associated medical conditions like epilepsy, Hyperkinesias, while 4% of all children with Mental Retardation are multiple handicapped. There are about 7.5 Million Mentally Retarded Children in India (NSSO,1991). There have been no systematic National survey to determine the prevalence of M.R. in India. However, in estimation the figures vary from 22 to 32.8 per thousand population. \r\n\r\nGenerally, mental retardation has a strong association with the family history the possibility of mentally retarded child is associated with the maternity age of before 18 and beyond 35. In rural areas the incidences of retardation is more, due to non scientific methods of delivery of the child. Such special children needs special educational care and required concerted efforts for their adjustment in the mainstream of society.\r\n\r\nRAJASTHAN MAHILA KALYAN MANDAL has been working in the field of training and education of mentally challenged children since last 10 years. Working in this field is actually a great challenge due to the ignorance, prejudice and biases of the community about these Mentally Retarded Children.\r\n\r\nWhen the organization started working on this issue, people''s support was "Absolutely Nil". People had a thinking that no one can work with these children and nothing can be done for these children. These children are considered to be the "Curse of the God and sin of their past life". Due to lack of awareness and knowledge these children were deprived from their basic right of education.\r\n\r\nEvery year the organization organizes various awareness programmes and also organizes exhibition in "Pushkar" fair to sensitize the community about the problems of Mental Retardation. Organisation is also arranging parents meeting for their involvement in Training & Education of these children. Workshops and training programmes for teachers and parents are also organised by the organization. These programmes follow a two pronged approach i.e. both intervention and rehabilitation of Mentally Retarded Children.\r\n\r\nThe current proposal is also framed in this direction. Through educational and vocational training, many children are working in shops, private services and such income generating activities. They are helping their parents and have now become an integral part of society. Our organisation also arranges regular medical checkup of these children for better development. RMKM also has linkages with National Institute Mentally Handicapped (NIMH), Secunderabad and other leading institutes in this field to improvise the Educational & Vocational training of these children.\r\n\r\nThrough this project, the organization RMKM has set up an inclusive school in Ajmer where quality education is imparted to mentally challenged children and normal children together. \r\n\r\nA parallel effort to reach out to more severely challenged children and those who are far away from the school, is done through Community Based Rehabilitation (CBR) program.

Although the location of this area is very much in the heart of Delhi but the socio economic condition of the people living here is very poor. Most of these families are migrants from states such as Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Uttar Pradesh. Here, they work as daily wage earners, as rag pickers or do menial jobs. They do not have a permanent place to live but live on squatters, in thatched huts or in rented accommodations. The area does not have any local opportunities for livelihood and so the adults travel off to Mehrauli or towards Faridabad for earning. For children, some of them go out to work and contribute to the family kitty, some accompany their parents to the work place, others look after their siblings or do household chores and the remaining largely spent the entire day on the streets playing cards, marbles, or abusing each other. Most of these children do not go to schools. The reason is that they are not welcomed in the government schools because of their poor habits, their uncivilized language and behaviour. A large majority of these children are in the age group of 4 - 14 years and they exist in big numbers. Many of these children were once enrolled in formal schools but because of the reasons mentioned above, they dropped out of schools. Besides these children, there are large number of girl children who were never enrolled in schools because their parents did not want them to be exposed to education. These mostly include girl children of minority community and girl children of migrated families.  \r\n\r\nThe other problem is of the high drop out rate of children from formal schools. This includes all those children whose names have been striked out from the class registers and all such children whose names might be there on the attendance register of the schools but they never go there physically. The most common reasons for the drop out of mainstreamed children are many:\r\nâ€¢	In ability to cope with studies;\r\nâ€¢	Lack of interest in studies;\r\nâ€¢	Punishment in school;\r\nâ€¢	Work at home;\r\nâ€¢	Care of sibling;\r\nâ€¢	Shifting of residence/ demolition of slum, etc;\r\nâ€¢	Seasonal migration; and \r\nâ€¢	Frequent illness due to poor hygienic conditions in which they live;\r\n\r\nOne of the major reasons for the high drop out rates of children in the formal schools is their inability to cope with studies and so the easiest way of escaping the situation is to drop out. The challenge is to ensure retention of mainstreamed children in schools. It has been noticed that in most cases the non formal education programs help children to understand the basic literacy and get them interested in education but the efforts go waste when these children after getting mainstreamed are not able to cope with studies in the formal schools. It is therefore the utmost need that all these children should be enrolled in remediation classes. Also all the students who are weak in studies should be also enrolled in remediation classes. This serves many purposes, firstly, it helps to retain the interest of children in studies, secondly, it helps to ensure that children continue in the schools, it helps children to get adjusted in the formal school environment and most importantly remediation helps to bridge the gaps which arise when these children return back to schools after the seasonal migration.  \r\n\r\nBut all the above efforts of preparing children for education will be incomplete if the parents are not roped into the program. And this can be made possible by regularly updating parents on the performance of their wards. The entire culture of education will percolate into this section of society only when parents can get assurance that their wards are performing. \r\n\r\nIt is with this background that the proposed project has been worked out.

After Vinoba Bhave passed away in 1983, Mr. Patil decided to move to Karjat where Vinobaji was born, and undertake the work of setting up a school for physically challenged children from adivasi villages that dot the hills adjacent to the Sahyadri range that passes by this region.\r\n\r\nIn these regions, physically challenged children were perceived as a burden by their families. The education department in this district did not support special education for these children. These individuals had to be dependent on someone else for their livelihood throughout their lives. The children, of course, were not admitted to regular schools. So we decided to teach these children ourselves. We requested the Rigad Jilha Parishad and the Khopoli Municipal Corporation for a room in one of the schools, which was granted. We then set about the task of locating physically challenged children (PCC) from surrounding villages, talking to their parents, and eventually, bringing some of them to live with us in our house. Others that lived close by were day students. We requested stores in the areas for contributions in terms of food and educational materials, and were able to get some donations. Thus we began the work of educating these children. Eventually, we also received aid from PPSSM (Punyatma Prabhakar Sharma Seva Mandal) and AID Boston. We were also given a house by a local donor where the children could live.\r\n\r\nCurrently we have 18 children in this residence. Once they have acquired basic language and lip reading skills, these children go to a regular school nearby. This whole process of integration is a great booster of their self-confidence. After a few years, they go back to live with their families and possibly continue their education in other schools if their family so desires. We also try to impart some vocational education at our residential school â€“ sewing, making sooth, making greeting cards and other art/craftwork.\r\n\r\nGoing back, crucially, once our students started going to the regular school they started interacting with the â€˜normalâ€™ children. Some also performed well in the classroom and/or outside. For example, though hearing-impaired children cannot speak, they do well at math and drawing. Their progress at school not only boosted their self-confidence, but also demonstrated their abilities to their parents, neighbors, and peers. This led to a big change in the way that people living in this region perceive these children. This is exactly what we have been striving for. If this change in perception could be made to happen in all the adivasi villages in Karjat taluka, it would pave the way for the all-round improvement in the quality of life for physically challenged individuals living here.\r\n\r\n- Subhash Patil', '1.

Alternative education techniques (non-formal) will be employed. They have found that the curriculum taught in schools is often irrelevant to the lives of disadvantaged children.  When parents don''t see results, it is more likely that children will discontinue their education. The project would like to give villagers the agency to decide what and how their children learn; and to make the curriculum more meaningful at the local level.  The proposed teaching style that encourages critical thinking as opposed to strict memorization and acceptance of information.  Curriculum will include extensive information about women''s health, women''s rights, legal rights of the poor, community governance, etc.\r\n\r\n Education is one of the most critical factors responsible for the development of a human being. Right to education, therefore, is held as a very important human right. Nevertheless children below the age of six years do not have the right to free and compulsory education because it provides free and compulsory education only to children who fall between the age group of six to fourteen years. Moreover, it is unfortunate that the government has still mulling over enacting a law to detail provisions on effecting the right to compulsory elementary education. \r\nSo, considering all the above said, the organisation will train the children in such a way that  they will start raising vioce against the injustice and fight for their rights to education.

Asha Dallas is supporting SEA''s motivation centers and teachers'' salaries. ', 'SEA works to alleviate the economic challenges faced by the fishermen community and salt pan workers of the Mamallapuram district through education.Often in these fishing communities, children begin fishing or salt panning from the tender age of 10 years dropping out of school. Entering the family tradition is a way of life. However, many find it a difficult occupation since traditional fishing is a job of high risks, where few reap the benefits of a good catch. As a result many of these fishermen and their families suffer socially and economically.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEA has developed several programs to improve the enrollment of school going children residing in this fishing community and reduce child labor. Services include increasing awareness about the value of education, creating motivation centers, child health programs, parent-teacher meetings and developing youth groups to eliminate child labor. They also support government schools by appointing well qualified teachers and taking care of their salaries,\r\n\r\nBackground and need for different programs:\r\nThe tsunami tragedy has affected the children as well as the community and aggravated poverty. There were less employment opportunities and abnormal fish catching, which has driven their immediate need from sending children to school to send them to some small establishments. Child Labour practice is not new to them. If the situation of the uncared continues then the vast number of school going children will be sent to work.\r\n\r\n1. Most of the people in the fishing villages are illiterate and do not realize the importance of education, as a result the children are not enrolled in regular schools at the right age. \r\n\r\nAn enrollment campaign would bring in awareness and motivate parents to enroll their children to regular schools. \r\n\r\n2. Due to poverty and inadequate income of the family, parents feel children as an asset in their family. By the time the children complete their primary education, both boys and girls become school dropouts, Boys take to their traditional job (fishing) and girls engage themselves as domestic maids or take care of their younger siblings while their parents are out on the job. \r\n\r\nThere is a need to identify such potential dropouts and motivate them to continue schooling through mentoring centers.\r\n\r\n3. The high rate of school dropouts is not only due to the economic background but it also largely dependent on the availability of local schools, proper teaching methodologies adopted by the school teachers, the ratio of teachers and children and also the association of parents with teachers. Most of the local schools in the villages have inadequate teachers, as a result managing children becomes highly challenging. The children do not receive adequate attention and leads to drop outs.\r\n \r\nHence appointing well qualified teachers also become an important project for this community. SEA works together with PTA and supplements government schools with more teachers.\r\n\r\nIn November 2008, Asha Dallas decided to support the motivations centers in two villages, and two teachers salary components for government schools in Gangadevankuppam and Alaperikuppam. In 2009, Dallas increased support for two more villages.

It provides education and support and counseling 24 hrs a day to the rescued children, and those in conflict with the law. It also reunites lost children with their families and has a full time child protection and legal services officer to help the vulnerable children. Further, the project strives to raise awareness of the plight of these children, and increase the involvement of local people, government, and the international community\r\n\r\nNeed for the project:\r\nThere is a dire need for programs working towards the welfare of street children in Bihar. Bihar is one of India’s poorest and most lawless states and civil administration is dysfunctional. Further, most aid agencies have pulled out of Bihar because of the dangerous conditions. In the district of Gaya, hundreds of street-children live on and around the station platforms. The children end up on the platforms due to a number of reasons. Some of them are orphaned children. Few are kids who have runaway from their homes due to abuse. Others are children separated from their kin during travel or because of kidnapping which is quite rampant in Bihar. The children on the railway platforms survive by begging, scavenging and rubbish-collecting. These children are at great risk from violence and abuse, including child-prostitution and trade in organs for transplants. Some of them also get involved in drug related activities. There is little or no government help for these children.  Apart from People First, there is no other organization working with these children.\r\n\r\nActivities:\r\nThe Junction is already operational in Gaya with a school and a small emergency shelter near the station. It provides a night shelter, washrooms, safe storage for their possessions, basic education and health care and vocational training to the rescued children.  Many of the children, due to their difficult life on the platforms, initially find it hard to trust the staff or live in the confines of the rescue home.  So Rescue Junction employs counselors trained in treating abuse related victims to help the children develop the trust and confidence.  The project also provides legal services to the kids who were involved in juvenile crime and were locked under barbaric conditions in remand homes. \r\n\r\nThe Staff also interacts with the police, railway authorities and local people to try to enhance child protection. The Staff makes a very serious effort to locate the parents of children who were accidentally separated from them. This endeavor by Rescue Junction has been widely lauded by the government, local police and media. \r\n\r\nBeneficiaries:\r\nThe immediate beneficiaries of this project will be around 200 children (aged 5 and upwards) living in or immediately around Gaya station, increasing to 1000+ children as facilities and services are established. People First has no religious or political affiliation and no such criteria is used while placing a child in the rescue homes.\r\n\r\nProject Development:\r\nThree organizations, including UNICEF, were consulted during the projects development. Evaluations have also been undertaken to compile a baseline survey to ascertain the nature of the problems the children face and the best ways to address them.  The project has been able to win the trust and support of local people living around the station. \r\n\r\nFunding request:\r\nOver a third of all children who come through the centre are girls, a vulnerable group. Currently children of both gender are housed in a single house that is overcrowded. People First, is seeking funding to construct a dedicated girl’s dormitory with a bathroom and employ 2 female counselors to provide support and advice to these youngsters in a safe and supportive environment.  \r\n\r\nSite Visit:\r\nAsha, Silicon Valley, has conducted a site visit to Rescue Junction in Sept 08 and has concluded that this project deserves to be fully supported. \r\n', 'People First Educational Charitable Trust', 'People First  based in Bodhgaya started its work in 1992 in the village of Piani, in Jharkhand India.

One key reason is the lack of learning and as the years pass the weaker children lag further and further behind till they finally drop out. Orthodox teaching methods, lack of facilities, monotonous books further fuel the disinterest in kids. So a big challenge is to improve the quality of education provided especially in primary schools. Given the enormity of the situation the Government is seeking support from non-profits like Akshara foundation, ASHA for Education, Pragathi to name a few.\r\n\r\nIt was realized through some studies and pilot projects that reading cards, which consisted of text, illustrations and colors, worked as a great catalyst to draw the attention of the students. Teachers were also trained on unconventional teaching methods, like encourage the children to come forth and make an effort to read/describe the cards using the pictures in the card. The cards when used as a supplement or even a replacement in certain cases proved extremely useful in exponentially increasing their reading abilities. This turned a considerable amount of kids who could not even recognize a letter of the alphabet to reading words within a very short duration.

Brthya conducts pilot projects for assessing the possibility of success, scalability and reliability. Once the concept is viable then Brthya locates Social Entrepreneurs. Sarva Vidya is one such concept.\r\n\r\nDuring the last decade, a number of small hospitals have emerged in cities across the country. With this increase in the number of hospitals, there has also been a corresponding increase in the demand for Nursing and Paramedical staff. For cost reasons, most of these small hospitals prefer to hire Nurse Aides and Nursing Assistants rather than a GNM. This has spawned a considerable demand for Nursing Aids and Assistants. Other areas where there are high demands for well qualified nurses are in geriatric care and home nursing for terminally ill patients.  Sarva Vidya seeks to educate and train under-privileged girl children and rural high school students in this area and enable them to support their families. \r\n\r\nSarva Vidya provides vocational training through conducting \r\nâ€¢	One Year Certification for Nursing Aid (41 Students currently enrolled).\r\nâ€¢	Two Year Diploma for Nursing Assistant. (There are 21 students for the first year and 6 students in the second year program.)\r\nFor the one year certification program, Sarva Vidya gets a list of students from Ramakrishna Institution. Students are also selected from the lower strata of the society with the help of another NGO known as SRS Sarvodaya. \r\n\r\nFor the two year program Sarva Vidya coordinator (Thenmozhi) goes to the nearby villages (nearer to the Chennai city) and solicits the help of local self help groups in selecting suitable candidates. In addition to this, the coordinator conducts career guidance programs in selected schools. During this process, suitable candidates (poor) are also selected for the one year program.\r\n\r\nSarva Vidya conducts these programs in the building of Sri Ramakrishnamath Saradha Vidhyalaya Higher Secondary School.The academic aspect of the curriculum is guided by Mrs. Saraswathi Vaidyanathan. She holds a Diploma in Nursing and has around 43 years of combined clinical and teaching experience. The program also employs 3 other instructors. Along with the academic aspect, Sarva Vidya works with various hospitals in Chennai to engage students in practical training and their future employment. \r\n\r\nThis project has been adapted as SUPPORT A CHILD PROGRAM.

Since education has limited scope of being innovative  the organisation always filled the gap by inventing  new methods that will help children learn better. The organisation always tried to instil some values and confidence in the children , which they are not usually expected to have. Constant effort had been to understand the psychological bent of mind through use of colour, music and other finer activities. In the initial years the children were presented with plants and they were asked to personify the plants and interact with them, take care of them. This was done to inculcate the sense of belonging, which the children  lacked.\r\nThe bonding between the family and the children by asking their mothers to aware of the of the activities the children were indulging in. Moreover  attempts were made to develop a stronger bonding between the mother and child . The  child was asked to take photo graphs of their mothers. The organisation still believes in overall development of a child more so on the mental development so that a child behave normally and find love and happiness and feel  life is worth living.\r\nToday, of course, work has expanded both in terms of geographical areas of operation and in the range of programmes.

Known as Sivanandha Block it serves as a multi-purpose hall used for giving physiotherapy to the children, doing prayer, and also as a dining cum dormitory for the girls presently under the residential care.  \r\n   \r\nHome for the disabled\r\n \r\nThis hall is a dormitory for the house mothers and kitchen for the home and was the first Building in our Rehabilitation efforts for the Polio affected children. This Building was our starting point in our dream to build a model Township for the Disabled and is known as SPIC hall. This was inaugurated on 12th March 1994  \r\n  \r\nThe home caters to the needs for the residential care children up-to 50. In this home deserving children from poor families are taken for complete care and boarding, lodging, rehabilitation and education is given free of cost.  \r\n  \r\nChildren will be selected in 3-8 age groups from extremely poor families. Children with greater disability will be given preferences. Children with no parent or one parent will be considered for priority attention. The Rehabilitation is given in three stages namely 1) Residential care stage 2) Day care stage and 3) Village Based Rehabitation stage. After 3-5 years of Residential care stage, the children will be promoted for Stage II Day care stage of Rehabilitation..  \r\n \r\n Caliper making center \r\nThe caliper making center is named after Mr.Gerhard Fischer and was inaugurated on 25th January 1996. \r\nIn the unit, we not only make calipers of light weight but also undertake repair work of PVC calipers which are light in weight and which have replaced the traditional heavy weight aluminum calipers.The Unit also supplies calipers against specific orders in addition to meeting its captive demand. The following statement brings into focus the functioning of this Unit. \r\n\r\n Integrated Middle School \r\nKnown as Siva Saraswathi Vidyalaya School (named after the parents of the Founder President S.Ramakrishnan) the School has two Blocks namely Dr.A.P.J.Abdulkalam Block for middle School Children and Sri Abinava Vidya Theertha Block for Primary School Children \r\n  \r\nThe school started with a humble beginning in 1991 has as on date a strength of 380 students of which 45 are physically challenged. The unique character of the school is that it is integrated in nature where the physically challenged mingle freely with the normal children. It is seen to be believed as to how both the groups go about their job and how the normal children help the disabled and how they exhibit understanding of the problem of the physically challenged. We advocate this example to be emulated. Since the school is situated in the campus itself and that too adjacent to the Home for the Disabled, there is no commuting problem, a good example of layout of different sections. \r\n  \r\nThe school is recognized by the Govt. of Tamil Nadu but functions without Govt. aid. Where as the normal children are required to pay nominal fees the disabled are given free education. To help the students attend the classes, we provide transportation at nominal charge to the normal children and here again the disabled are afforded free commuting facilities to the school. The Daycare children who are those graduating from residential care also attend the Integrated school from nearby villages.\r\n \r\n  \r\nThe school has besides trained staff, a physical instructor to impart physical education. There is a good playground for the students with an amusement park. \r\n\r\nSpastic Centre \r\n  \r\nAs on date there are 18 MR & CP (Mentally Retarded and Cerebral Palsy) children of different age groups (below the age of 15). The centre started in 1997 aims at rehabilitating MR & CP children to such an extent that they are trained to look after themselves with regard to their personal hygiene and food habits. The progress is necessarily slow but steady. For the strength of 18 children we have five teachers, for the children require intensive care \r\n  \r\nThe Centre being a Day Care Centre organizes to bring the children living on the outskirts of Amar Seva Sangam to the Centre by our own transport in such a way that the children reach the Centre by 10.30 a.m. during the week days and remain till 2.30 p.m. and dropped back by our own transport. The children are given free snacks and food and the parents of the children are given a nominal financial support of Rs.100/- per month to enable them take care of the immediate needs of their wards. \r\n  \r\nSince the Institution''s aim is to reach the needy at their doorsteps, we have opened a sub-Centre for MR & CP children (which has a strength of six children now) at a place called Elathur, which is just 8 kms from Amar Seva Sangam. \r\n\r\nVocational Training: The Vocational Training Centre includes six different facilities (Computer Centre, Typing Centre, Two Wheeler Mechanic- Training Centre, Note Book Making & Binding Centre, Tailoring & Handicrafts Centre, Spirulina Centre: Production & Marketing of high quality Spirulina). Individuals are trained to become autonomous workers in one of the six disciplines before being reintegrated into their native communities.\r\n   \r\nPost Acute Care\r\n\r\nBuilt at a considerable cost, the hostel and the Physiotherapy Unit at Amar Seva Sangam offer a fully equipped state-of-the-art technology, unique in this part of the country, comparable to international standards.\r\n\r\nThe hostel has the capacity to accommodate 20 beds and admission will be on "First come first serve" basis. \r\n   \r\nVillage Based Rehabilitation (VBR) Initiatives  \r\nCreating awareness about disability, its causes and management by street campaigns, plays and other means of communication.\r\nPrevention, early intervention, care-giving and rehabilitation those affected.\r\nFormation of Self-Help Groups of the physically challenged, training them in vocational skills to make them earn their living.\r\n\r\nThe Village Based Rehabilitation (VBR) Center, which operates in tandem with Day Care, assists individuals in surrounding communities through the Caliper Making Centre, Disabled Youth Training Program, and Post-Acute-Care Program.

While the teaching techniques are quite different from regular schools and is activity based the curriculum has been a bottleneck in making a significant impact through education.

Thoothukudi district is in the south of TamilNadu and is one of the backward districts in terms of economic indicators, social progress and industrialization. It is also a notoriously dry district and agriculture is completely dependent on the monsoons. Some of the blocks in this district are rain-shadow regions and receive no more than 10-15 days of rains in a year. Livelihood options for the people here are quite limited and migration to urban areas in search of jobs is quite common. With respect to education, access to schools for the underprivileged children is not an issue, especially at the primary school level (classes 1-5) but the quality of education is quite suspect.\r\n\r\nA couple of Asha Chennai volunteers visited several remote government schools in three blocks of Thoothukudi namely Ottapidaram, Vilathikulam and Kayathar during the 2008-09 academic year. We identified schools where the pupil-teacher ratio (PTR) was more than the government-mandated ratio of 40:1, visited them and interacted with the school teachers to understand the issues they were facing. Activity-Based Learning (ABL) was introduced for all primary level classes in TamilNadu about three years back. Teachers need to dedicate a lot more time to students on an individual basis under this methodology. Our interaction with teachers in these schools and several schools over the past couple of years presented a common picture - the mandated PTR of 40:1 was way too high and the ABL methodology would be absolutely ineffective in such a scenario.

The curriculum was a carbon copy of what was developed in the West in the days when a standard industrial society with unlimited growth seemed to be the only society which would exist in the world.

In the case of India, Rabindranath Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi had proposed alternatives which were not taken up after Independence; but we believed that the time was right to re-construct their ideas in today’s context and carry out appropriate experiments. \r\n\r\nIn addition, we found several organizations working in the area of primary & pre-primary education that caters to children up to 9-10 years.

The aim is to mainstream as many students as possible into nearby government schools.', 'Jaipur is well known as the worldwide capital for Jewels. This industry is one of the most important one in this area and involves a significant part of the people living there. In the conception of a jewel, there are different steps that start from the faceting of the brute stone to the final sell in a shop. The artisans are working at the base of this chain and they sell their labor to the middlemen at a very low cost. The artisans have been an outcast in the society for ages and live in the slums at the outskirts of Jaipur. They have been exploited by the middle men of the jewellery trade for ages; one of the main reasons being a lack of any form of education. There is a complete lack of awareness of the importance of education among this population. They continue using old techniques, passed on by their ancestors and are hardly aware about innovation. Put together, their situation becomes precarious and heavily dependent on the middlemen and buyers who hold a place at the top of the industry.\r\nAlready working on different livelihood projects for these artisans, JKSMS staff were convinced that the role of the artisans in the jewel industry had to be strengthened in order to improve their life conditions. We felt that the best way to develop self esteem, self confidence and awareness among the artisans could be through education, a component which is completely lacking in this community. Unfortunately, the artisans themselves are not aware about the importance of education for their children. \r\nThe â€˜Interactive Learning Methodsâ€™ schoolâ€™ (ILM-school) concept has been created to make learning fun. We use lot of interactive methods (images, games etc.) to teach basic lessons to children. Indeed, when exposed to such learning methods, most of the children are able to understand and retain what is being taught. Besides, they â€˜wantâ€™ to come back to learn more, unlike the situation in govt. schools. We closely monitor and record the progress of each student through regular tests. We also keep the parents updated by having regular meetings with parents of every child. After 6 months and then 1 year, the children are evaluated to determine if they are ready to be â€˜mainstreamedâ€™ into govt. schools. The children who are mainstreamed continue to be given help by the teachers at the ILM School in the after-school hours. This is because each child takes some time to adapt to the change from the non-conventional ILM School to the govt. school. The kids who donâ€™t get mainstreamed continue learning in the ILM School till they are evaluated as â€˜readyâ€™ for the transition. \r\nWe aim to generate awareness in the community about the importance of education in their lives and how that could make their lives better. We believe that creation of schools for the children of artisans and initiating the concept of education among this group should help prevent their exploitation, help them integrate in the society and in the long run, lead to their self-sustainability. We also hope that seeing the impact of education on the confidence and awareness among some of the children in their community, and the vast array of opportunities that opens up to these children, more and more parents would enthusiastically start sending their kids to nearby govt. and/or private schools.

These schools come under a special category called ''Alternative Education'' schools (Alt-ed schools) because they seek to explore different alternatives in education. Such schools continue to encourage the spirit of enquiry in a child and help them make their choices based on nurturing the child''s interest and learning. A lot of importance is given to the child''s psychology at an early age so that they loose the psychological fears or complexes they may have towards learning. This encourages children to think independently and become more responsible. Most of these schools are engaged in creating and using innovative teaching methodologies that ensure that rote learning does not happen. As an example - some schools have developed excellent language teaching methodologies. Others may use creative games and experiments to explain difficult concepts in Math or Science. Some schools have changed the class room structure to encourage better children and teachers interaction. Such creativity is typically missing in the conventional education stream practiced by majority of schools in India. Alt-ed schools are often founded by persons with a strong interest in what education means, and what it should provide. Since the established patterns in the conventional education system in India are missing many aspects of what education is for - alternative education schools try to address these inadequacies and create a space for exploring alternatives in education. \r\n<br><br>\r\nAlt-ed schools that Asha supports have been especially created to not only address the pitfalls in the conventional education system but also ensure that children from poor socio-economic backgrounds are not deprived of the opportunity for high quality education.

Government schools in India cater to the poorest sections of society and have suffered from years of indifference to the dismal plight of schools. They are plagued by several problems including poor infrastructure, poor teacher attendance, bad teaching quality and complete lack of sensitivity to the communities they cater to. There are several groups in India whose specific mission is to reform the government schooling system since most of India’s poorest send their children to government schools. \r\n<br><br>\r\nAsha has been working in conjunction with several partners in making improvements to infrastructure and quality of schooling. In some cases we have supported social workers who work with existing schools to make changes. We has also been involved with infrastructure improvements in some government schools. We have also supported fellowships to individuals who have taken up the task of reforming the teaching quality of a group of schools. \r\n<br><br>\r\nEducational Reform Support\r\n<br><br>\r\nAsha volunteers have been actively involved in campaigns involving review of government proposed curriculum frameworks. We have also actively supported innovative education experiments. In cases where innovative reform has run into problems with the government we have actively shown our support for quality education initiatives and campaigned along with our partners in India. The basic premise behind these interventions is the firm belief that the State should be held accountable for providing affordable, yet quality education to each child.\r\n<br><br>\r\nGovernment School Curriculum interventions\r\n<br><br>\r\nSeveral groups in India are involved with creating innovative curriculum in different areas such as mathematics, languages, sciences and new areas such as environmental awareness, social issues and health-care. Some have chosen to work with government schools to ensure that the quality improvements being made are available to children of poorer sections. Asha is working with partner groups in providing support towards developing prototype educational material, conducting teachers training and awareness workshops, researching future areas of work.', '2002-12-04 17:05:00', '2002-12-04 17:05:00'),
